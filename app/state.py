State Management for Data Analysis Assistant

This module handles workflow stage transitions and state management for the
data analysis assistant, allowing for better separation of UI and business logic.

The module provides:
1. Constants defining workflow stages and their properties
2. A state machine to manage transitions between workflow stages
3. Methods to validate and control the analysis pipeline flow
4. Stage completion tracking and state flags
