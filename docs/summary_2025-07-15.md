# Daily Summary – 2025-07-15

Today's focus: kick-starting the **Ask Anything AI assistant** loop

## What we did ✅
1. **Implemented first unit tests for intent parsing**  
   • Added `tests/intent/test_get_query_intent.py` with monkey-patched LLM so it runs offline.  
   • Covers three core scenarios: count + filter, average + filter, distribution.  
2. **Read through existing architecture & roadmap docs** to align next coding steps.

## Next up ▶️
- Wire code-generation templates (`AIHelper.generate_analysis_code`) into tests.
- Integrate new intent parser with `DataAnalysisAssistant` happy path.
- Add smoke test exercising full query → intent → code → exec chain.
