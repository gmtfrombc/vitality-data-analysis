# Testing Session 020 â€“ 2025-05-15

## Objective
Address and resolve discrepancies in the AI assistant's SQL generation, specifically for queries involving BMI and patient counts, to ensure accurate responses.

## Issues Addressed
1.  **Incorrect BMI Column Querying:** The assistant was attempting to query a `bmi` column directly from the `patients` table, which does not exist. BMI is stored in the `vitals` table.
2.  **Incorrect Patient Counting with Joins:** When queries required joining tables (e.g., `patients` and `vitals` for BMI-related questions), the assistant was counting all joined rows instead of distinct patients, leading to inflated counts.

## Implementation Fixes in `app/ai_helper.py`

1.  **Schema Awareness for BMI:**
    *   Updated `_build_filters_clause` to correctly prefix BMI-related conditions with the `vitals.` table alias.
    *   Modified the table selection logic in `_build_code_from_intent` to ensure `vitals` is joined when BMI is part of filters or conditions.
    *   Ensured that `metric_name` (like `bmi`) is correctly prefixed (e.g., `vitals.bmi`) in aggregate expressions when joins occur.

2.  **Accurate Patient Counting (`COUNT(DISTINCT patients.id)`):**
    *   The core logic for `agg_expr` (around line 1360-1370) was revised.
    *   Specifically, for `intent.analysis_type == "count"`, the `agg_expr` is now set to `COUNT(DISTINCT patients.id)` if:
        *   Multiple tables are needed for the query (`len(tables_needed) > 1`) AND `patients` is one of those tables, OR
        *   The `metric_name` (derived from `intent.target_field`) is one of `patient_id`, `id`, or `patients`.
    *   This ensures that when counting entities that are patients, even in the absence of explicit joins (e.g. "count patients by gender"), or when joins could cause row duplication, we count unique patient identifiers.

## Testing & Validation
*   **Initial Bug:** A query like "How many active female patients have a BMI under 30?" was returning an incorrect count (e.g., 48 instead of the correct 8) due to counting joined `vitals` rows. The SQL generated was `SELECT COUNT(*) ... FROM patients LEFT JOIN vitals ... WHERE ...`.
*   **Fix Verification:**
    *   The `app/ai_helper.py` was updated to generate `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT patients.id) ...` for such queries.
    *   Unit tests in `tests/intent/test_group_by_templates.py` (specifically `test_group_by_count_gender`) were updated and confirmed to pass, ensuring the `GROUP BY` logic correctly uses `COUNT(DISTINCT patients.id)` when the intent is to count patients.
    *   Direct SQL query against `mock_patient_data.db` (`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) FROM patients p JOIN vitals v ON p.id = v.patient_id WHERE p.active = 1 AND p.gender = 'F' AND v.bmi < 30;`) confirmed the correct answer is 8.
    *   Application re-run with the fixed `ai_helper.py` yielded the correct answer of 8 for the test query.

## Conclusion
The AI assistant's SQL generation for queries involving BMI and patient counts has been significantly improved, leading to more accurate data analysis results. The system now correctly handles table joins for BMI and ensures distinct patient counts.
