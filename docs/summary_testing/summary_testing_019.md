# Testing Session 019 – 2025-05-14

## Objective
Implement a feature for identifying patients with clinical measurements suggesting conditions (e.g., obesity, prediabetes) but lacking corresponding diagnoses in their Past Medical History (PMH) records.

## Implementation Overview
1. **Core Components Developed:**
   - **gap_report.py**: SQL-based detection framework for condition gaps
   - **Panel UI**: User-friendly interface for condition selection and results viewing
   - **CLI Tool**: Command-line access for batch reporting and automation

2. **Supported Conditions:**
   - Obesity (BMI ≥ 30)
   - Morbid Obesity (BMI ≥ 40)
   - Prediabetes (A1C 5.7-6.4)
   - Type 2 Diabetes (A1C ≥ 6.5)

3. **Technical Architecture:**
   - Reusable SQL Common Table Expression (CTE) generation
   - Common code path for CLI, UI, and future assistant integration
   - LEFT JOIN pattern to find measurement-positive, diagnosis-negative records
   - User-friendly date formatting (May 14, 2025 vs. 2025-05-14T00:00:00.000Z)

## Key Features

### 1. Condition Gap SQL Generator
- SQL generation for vitals-based conditions (BMI)
- SQL generation for lab-based conditions (A1C)
- ICD-10 code mapping via condition_mapper
- Support for both code-based and text-based condition matching
- Active-only patient filtering option

### 2. Data-Quality Gaps UI Tab
- Dropdown for condition selection
- Active-only toggle checkbox
- Run button to execute the query
- CSV download functionality
- Tabular display with pagination
- Empty-state handling

### 3. Command-Line Interface
- `python -m scripts.generate_gap_report -c obesity -a`
- Options for condition, active-only flag, and output file path
- Human-readable console output and optional CSV export

## Testing Performed
1. **SQL Correctness:**
   - Verified LEFT JOIN pattern correctly excludes patients with PMH entries
   - Confirmed threshold-based filtering (BMI ≥ 30, A1C ≥ 5.7)
   - Tested condition synonyms resolve to canonical rules

2. **UI Testing:**
   - Confirmed visibility state changes based on empty/populated results
   - Verified CSV download works correctly
   - Tested date formatting for improved readability

3. **CLI Testing:**
   - Verified command-line arguments parsing
   - Confirmed CSV export functionality

## Future Enhancements
1. **Assistant Integration:**
   - Add template for natural language queries like "Show patients who meet criteria for obesity but lack diagnosis"
   - Enable count queries ("How many active patients have undiagnosed diabetes?")

2. **Expanded Condition Support:**
   - Hypertension (BP ≥ 130/80)
   - Hyperlipidemia (LDL ≥ 130)
   - Additional conditions with clinical measurement criteria

3. **Workflow Improvements:**
   - EMR link generation for direct editing
   - Batch operations to mark patients for follow-up
   - Integration with notification system for providers

## Conclusion
The Data-Quality Gaps feature successfully addresses the need to identify patients with potential undiagnosed conditions based on clinical measurements. This will support clinicians in maintaining accurate medical records and ensuring proper coding for conditions evident in patient measurements.
