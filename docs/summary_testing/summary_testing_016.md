# Testing Session 016 – 2025-05-18

## Objective
Resolve the condition mapping issue with mental health conditions, particularly anxiety, failing to properly generate SQL code that uses ICD-10 codes from the condition mapper.

## Issue Analysis
1. **Query failure:** "How many active patients have anxiety?" fails with the error: "no such column: score_type"
2. **Root cause identified:**
   - The system doesn't detect anxiety as a condition when it's mentioned in a filter value
   - The code generation doesn't properly integrate with the condition mapper when conditions are mentioned in filters
   - Similar issue to the previously identified obesity mapping problem, but with mental health conditions

3. **Specific failure points:**
   - The `_build_code_from_intent` function didn't check filter values to see if they map to conditions
   - The generated SQL incorrectly used `score_type` column which doesn't exist in the schema
   - YAML indentation errors in the condition mappings file for some conditions like "pure hyperglyceridemia"

## Resolution Steps
1. **Improved condition detection:**
   - Added logic to detect when a filter value maps to a condition even if the filter field isn't explicitly set as CONDITION_FIELD
   - Implemented a check to scan all filter values for potential condition matches

2. **Fixed code generation:**
   - Created a proper `_generate_condition_count_code` helper function to handle condition-based queries
   - Ensured the function properly translates condition terms to ICD-10 codes via the condition mapper
   - Implemented SQL generation that correctly joins the PMH (past medical history) table with patient data

3. **YAML file fixes:**
   - Corrected indentation issues in the condition mappings YAML file
   - Ensured all condition entries follow consistent formatting

4. **Testing:**
   - Verified the fix with test queries for conditions like "anxiety"
   - Confirmed that SQL generation now properly includes the relevant ICD-10 codes

## Results
1. The system now correctly recognizes condition terms in filter values and maps them to ICD-10 codes
2. Generated SQL properly joins the PMH table and filters on the appropriate condition codes
3. Queries like "How many active patients have anxiety?" now work correctly

## Next Steps
1. **Implement co-condition support:**
   - Add functionality to handle queries with multiple conditions (e.g., "How many patients have obesity AND hypertension?")
   - Extend the condition detection and SQL generation to handle logical operators between conditions

2. **Add regression tests:**
   - Create comprehensive tests for different condition types (chronic, mental health, metabolic, etc.)
   - Ensure full test coverage of the condition mapping and SQL generation logic

3. **Refactor for clarity:**
   - Consider refactoring the condition mapping logic for better maintainability
   - Add more detailed logging to make the condition detection flow easier to trace

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update developer documentation with examples of how the condition mapping flow works
   - Document the supported condition query patterns for reference
