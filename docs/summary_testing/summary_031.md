# Metabolic Health Program - Session 031 Summary

## Program Completer vs Dropout Analysis

### Overview
This session focused on implementing and analyzing program dropout functionality to complement the existing program completer definition. The goal was to better understand differences between patients who complete the program successfully versus those who drop out before completion.

### Definition
- **Program Completer**: A patient who (1) is currently inactive (active=0) and (2) has completed at least 7 provider visits
- **Program Dropout**: A patient who (1) is currently inactive (active=0) and (2) has NOT completed at least 7 provider visits

### Implementation
1. **Added Dropout Definition**: Added `is_program_dropout()` function to `app/utils/patient_attributes.py`
2. **Updated Status Function**: Modified `get_patient_status()` to use the new dropout function
3. **Added Canonical Field**: Added `program_dropout` to canonical fields in `app/utils/query_intent.py`
4. **Added Synonyms**: Added various synonyms for program dropout (e.g., "dropped out", "didn't finish")
5. **Enhanced UI Support**: Added dropout detection to `data_assistant.py` to support natural language queries
6. **Created Tests**: Updated and augmented tests to verify dropout functionality works correctly
7. **Analysis Script**: Created `analyze_program_completion.py` script for comprehensive analysis

### Verification Results
All tests passed successfully, confirming that the dropout functionality works as expected. The implementation properly distinguishes between:
- Active patients (currently in the program)
- Program completers (inactive, ≥7 provider visits)
- Program dropouts (inactive, <7 provider visits)

### Analysis Capabilities
The new analysis script (`analyze_program_completion.py`) provides:
- Program status distribution (completers vs dropouts vs active)
- Provider visit patterns comparison between completers and dropouts
- Health metrics comparison (BMI, weight, blood pressure) between groups
- Demographic analysis by completion status

### Example Queries Now Supported
- "How many patients dropped out of the program?"
- "What's the average BMI for patients who didn't finish the program?"
- "Compare completers and dropouts by gender"
- "How many provider visits do dropouts typically have?"

### Next Steps
1. **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add advanced visualizations showing reasons for dropout
2. **Time-to-Dropout Analysis**: Analyze how long patients typically stay before dropping out
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Identify early indicators that might predict future dropouts
4. **Intervention Opportunities**: Analyze critical timepoints where intervention might prevent dropout
