# Silent Dropout Detection Implementation (Summary 032)

## Overview
Implemented a "Silent Dropout Detection" feature to identify patients who are still marked as active in the system but haven't had any clinical activity (lab tests, mental health screenings, or vitals measurements) in a configurable time period (default: 90 days).

## Key Components

### Database Queries
- Created robust query mechanism that identifies potential silent dropouts based on lack of clinical activity
- Leverages existing data points (lab tests, mental health screenings, vitals) for detection
- Includes filters for minimum past activity count to focus on previously engaged patients
- Uses SQLite window functions and joins for efficient patient activity analysis

### UI Implementation
- Created Panel-based page with configurable parameters:
  - Inactivity threshold (days without clinical activity)
  - Minimum activity count (to filter out patients with insufficient history)
  - Active-only toggle (to focus on currently active patients)
- Added data visualizations including:
  - Tabular display with patient details and last activity dates
  - Color-coded count indicator showing severity of dropout issue
  - Interactive row selection for bulk actions

### Patient Management
- Implemented ability to mark selected patients as inactive
- Added CSV export functionality for offline processing
- Includes proper error handling and user feedback messages

## Technical Notes
- Does not require database schema changes, works with existing data tables
- Uses real clinical data points rather than simulated visit dates
- Built on existing `patient_visit_metrics` module architecture
- Includes proper error handling for database queries

## Challenges Addressed
- Initially over-reported potential dropouts due to including patients with no clinical history
- Added filters to require minimum clinical activity count to be considered a "dropout"
- Added program enrollment time checks to avoid flagging recent enrollees
- Added color-coded total count indicator to visualize severity

## Test Coverage
- Added comprehensive unit tests for the core detection function
- Addressed test failures with proper mocking of database connections
- Added test for empty result handling and error conditions

## Next Steps
- Consider aggregating silent dropout data into program-level metrics dashboard
- Evaluate need for automated notifications or reports for clinical staff
- Add scheduled batch processing to regularly identify new silent dropouts
