# Testing Session 012 – 2025-05-11

## Context

Goal of the session was to refactor duplicated patient-attribute semantics
(`active`, `gender`, etc.) into a central Enum module.  Work began by adding
`app/utils/patient_attributes.py` and replacing literals in a few modules.

## What Happened

1. Created `patient_attributes.py` with `Active`, `Gender` Enums and
   helper mappings (`ATTRIBUTE_LABELS`, `BOOLEAN_FIELDS`).
2. Replaced some `== 1` and `== "M"/"F"` literals in
   `db_query.py`, `patient_view.py`, and **started** updates in
   `app/pages/data_assistant.py`.
3. While patching `data_assistant.py`, a series of rapid, overlapping
   edits removed imports and broke indentation – resulting in >150 syntax
   errors and test failures.
4. Decision made to **roll back** `data_assistant.py` to last clean
   commit using `git restore` and pause the refactor.

## Current State

* `patient_attributes.py` exists and is imported by
  `db_query.py` & `patient_view.py`.
* `data_assistant.py` is back to its pre-refactor state (lints & tests
  pass locally).
* ROADMAP updated with a tracked milestone to resume the refactor in a
  controlled, incremental fashion.

## Next Steps (for next assistant)

1. Re-apply **small, reviewed** enum replacements to `data_assistant.py`
   (approx. 5 occurrences) – commit & test after each logical chunk.
2. Remove duplicate `bool_fields` map in `db_query.py` and switch to
   `label_for` helper.
3. Update any tests that still rely on numeric/gender literals.
4. Expose `ATTRIBUTE_LABELS` to `ai_helper.get_data_schema()` so the LLM
   gets canonical names.
5. (Optional) Add CHECK constraints for enum values via migration.
