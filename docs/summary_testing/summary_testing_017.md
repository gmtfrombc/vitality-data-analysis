# Testing Session 017 – 2025-05-19

## Objective
Improve the condition query handling mechanism to prevent "no such column: score_type" errors when users ask questions about conditions that aren't explicitly in the CONDITION_FIELD (e.g., "How many patients have obesity?").

## Issue Analysis
1. **Query failure:** Despite previous fixes, condition-related queries were still failing with "no such column: score_type" error
2. **Root cause identified:**
   - Intent recognition correctly identified condition terms, but these weren't being properly processed for SQL generation
   - The system would incorrectly try to filter on columns like `score_type` that don't exist in the database
   - Post-processing recommendations from previous sessions were not fully implemented

3. **Specific failure points:**
   - The condition detection in `query_intent.py` wasn't properly connected to `ai_helper.py`
   - The `_generate_condition_count_code` function didn't handle redundant filters that duplicated the condition value
   - Edge cases like glucose-related queries were failing due to over-aggressive filtering

## Resolution Steps
1. **Enhanced condition detection pipeline:**
   - Added `inject_condition_filters_from_query` call inside `get_query_intent` to ensure condition detection happens early
   - This ensures that all condition terms are properly tagged before SQL generation

2. **Improved filter handling:**
   - Modified `_generate_condition_count_code` to intelligently filter out redundant filters
   - Added logic to detect and remove filters whose value matches the detected condition value
   - Prevents SQL generation with invalid columns like `score_type`

3. **Fixed edge cases:**
   - Refined the filter cleanup to avoid removing legitimate filters in queries like "variance in glucose"
   - Added more precise matching to distinguish between condition terms and similar metric names

4. **Testing:**
   - Validated the fix with all existing test cases
   - Fixed a failing test for glucose measurements that was incorrectly being filtered out

## Results
1. All tests now pass including condition-based queries and edge cases
2. The system correctly handles questions about obesity, anxiety, depression, hypertension, and other conditions
3. SQL generation produces valid queries that use the appropriate ICD-10 codes from the condition mapper

## Current State of Condition Queries
1. **Detection:** The system can now detect condition terms whether they are:
   - Explicitly marked with the CONDITION_FIELD
   - Embedded in other filter values
   - Mentioned directly in the query text

2. **Processing:**
   - Conditions are properly mapped to their canonical names and ICD-10 codes
   - The SQL generation uses the appropriate database schema and joins
   - Redundant filters are automatically removed to prevent SQL errors

3. **Support:**
   - Single condition queries work reliably for all condition types
   - Complex temporal comparisons work (e.g., "more X patients this year than last")
   - Demographic breakdowns work (e.g., "patients with X by age group")

## Next Steps
1. **Co-condition support:**
   - Implement support for queries with multiple conditions (e.g., "patients with both obesity AND hypertension")
   - Add logical operator handling (AND/OR) for condition combinations

2. **Edge case coverage:**
   - Add specific tests for less common conditions to ensure consistent behavior
   - Improve handling of negated conditions (e.g., "patients without diabetes")

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update developer documentation with the enhanced condition detection flow
   - Document supported query patterns and examples for clinical users
