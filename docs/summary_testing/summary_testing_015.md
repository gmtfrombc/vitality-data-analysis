# Testing Session 015 – 2025-05-15

## Objective
Resolve the issue with the condition mapping system failing when handling obesity-related queries, particularly the "morbid obesity" condition.

## Issue Analysis
1. **Query failure:** "How many active patients have morbid obesity?" fails with the error: "no such column: score_type"
2. **Root cause identified:**
   - The intent classification system correctly maps "morbid obesity" to the condition field
   - However, the code generation phase produces SQL that incorrectly attempts to filter on `bmi` values directly
   - This bypasses the ICD-10 code mapping that has been implemented, resulting in invalid SQL

3. **Specific failure point:**
   - The generated SQL tries to use `WHERE active = 1 AND score_type = 'depression'` instead of using the proper PMH table condition codes
   - The system doesn't properly integrate the condition mapper's ICD-10 codes (E66.01 for morbid obesity)
   - Inconsistency between intent parser and code generation for obesity-related terms

## Key Findings
1. **Intent-Code Mismatch:** The intent classification correctly handles obesity terms as conditions, but this doesn't properly flow through to code generation.
2. **Missed Logic Branch:** Code generation tries to use BMI numerical filters instead of ICD-10 codes for obesity conditions.
3. **Score Type Column Issue:** Inconsistent schema understanding in generated SQL (trying to use non-existent columns).
4. **Sandbox Failure:** The sandbox correctly reports the SQL error but the error message isn't properly surfaced to users.

## Recommendations for Next Steps
1. **Fix condition detection in code generation:**
   - Modify `ai_helper.py` to prioritize condition mapping over BMI direct filtering for obesity-related queries
   - Ensure the `_generate_condition_count_code` function is called for all obesity conditions

2. **Improve condition mapping flow:**
   - Add clear log statements to trace condition mapping path for debugging
   - Add explicit checks for obesity-related conditions in `_generate_analysis_code` 
   - Ensure obesity terms reliably trigger condition-based code generation

3. **Enhance obesity detection:** 
   - Add more comprehensive synonyms for obesity conditions in the YAML mapping
   - Implement special handling for BMI-related queries to direct them to appropriate condition mappings

4. **Fix schema mismatch:**
   - Update SQL templates to ensure proper table references for condition-related queries
   - Add schema validation step before executing sandbox code

5. **Add regression tests:**
   - Create specific test cases for each obesity condition query
   - Add golden tests that verify the full pipeline for obesity-related conditions
   - Ensure the test suite catches any regressions in condition mapping
