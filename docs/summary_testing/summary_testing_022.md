# Testing Session 022 – 2025-05-23

## Objective
Implement unit conversion for weight change analysis to display results in pounds (lbs) instead of kilograms (kg).

## Issue Observed
The weight change analysis was correctly calculating weight loss/gain values but reporting them in kilograms, while users expect to see results in pounds (lbs). This was inconsistent with the rest of the application which presents weight in imperial units (pounds).

## What We Did
1. **Identified Code Location** – Examined the `_generate_relative_change_analysis_code` function in `app/ai_helper.py`.
2. **Added Unit Conversion** – Implemented conversion from kg to lbs in the code generation template:
   ```python
   # Convert the change from kg to pounds (1 kg = 2.20462 lbs)
   _merged['change_lbs'] = _merged['change'] * 2.20462
   ```
3. **Updated Results Dictionary** – Modified the results dictionary to use the converted values:
   ```python
   'average_change': float(_merged['change_lbs'].mean()),  # Using pounds instead of kg
   'unit': 'lbs',  # Explicitly specify the unit
   ```
4. **Created Test Script** – Implemented `test_weight_change_with_units.py` to verify the conversion logic works correctly.
5. **Executed Verification** – Ran the test script to confirm that weight change is now properly reported in pounds with a unit indicator.

## Verification Results
The test script produced the expected results, confirming that:
- Weight change calculations now include conversion to pounds
- Results explicitly indicate the unit (lbs)
- The conversion factor of 2.20462 is properly applied

## Additional Benefits
1. **Improved Clarity** – Results now explicitly specify the unit of measurement, enhancing user understanding.
2. **Consistent Units** – Weight-related analyses now consistently use pounds throughout the application.

## Documentation Updates
1. Updated CHANGELOG.md with the unit conversion improvement
2. Updated ROADMAP_CANVAS.md to reflect completion of this task
3. Created this summary testing document to record the changes
