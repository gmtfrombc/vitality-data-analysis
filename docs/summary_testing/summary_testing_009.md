# Summary of Testing Sprint 009: Sandbox Performance Improvements

**Date: May 12, 2025**  
**Focus: Test performance and stability**

## Goals
- Investigate and resolve sandbox execution hangs during test runs
- Fix slow tests that previously took several minutes to run
- Improve test stability for visualization components

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Sandbox Performance Optimization
- **Issue Identified:** Tests would hang for 10+ minutes at 15/286 tests due to expensive `inspect.stack()` calls in the sandbox import hook
- **Root Cause:** The import hook meant to provide special bypass for trusted callers was walking the entire Python call stack for **every import** during first-time module loading
- **Fix:** Removed the expensive `inspect.stack()` bypass and rely solely on the whitelist approach
- **Result:** Testing time reduced from 10+ minutes to ~10 seconds for the same tests

### 2. Visualization Component Testing
- **Strategy:** Created lightweight stubs in `tests/conftest.py` for HoloViews/hvPlot to avoid:
  - Expensive first-time imports (Bokeh, Jinja2, etc.)
  - Test failures when visualization is intentionally disabled in sandbox
- **Components Stubbed:**
  - Basic HoloViews elements (Element, Overlay, Div, Scatter)
  - HoloViews Store and registry structure
  - DataFrame/Series .hvplot accessor with mock output objects

### 3. Remaining Test Issues
- Several golden query tests still fail with minor differences (76 vs 76.5, etc.)
- Integration tests with deeper visualization dependencies require additional work
- A detailed summary is provided in `docs/pytest_errors.md` for next steps

## Lessons Learned
1. `inspect.stack()` is extremely expensive (>1000x slower than simple attribute checks) - avoid in hot paths
2. Mock critical dependencies in tests rather than importing real implementations
3. Use test-time stubs for visualization libraries to keep tests fast and stable

## Next Steps
1. Address remaining test failures with appropriate test-time mocks
2. Consider adding test metadata for visualization-dependent tests (to skip or xfail when plotting disabled)
3. Maintain the separation between runtime (sandbox) and test-time (conftest.py) configurations

## Metrics
- Testing speed: 10+ minutes â†’ 10 seconds
- Passing tests: Increased substantially for intent and golden query tests
