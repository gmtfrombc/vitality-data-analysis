# Data-Validation Sprint – Summary 012 (2025-05-08)

## What We Did in This Session

1. **Patient Data-Quality Dashboard Implementation**  
   • Designed and implemented a comprehensive patient-centric data quality dashboard UI.  
   • Added six key UI components per spec:
     - **Header bar** with patient name, MRN, age/sex and a colored Record Quality badge (% of passing blocking rules).
     - **Status tiles** for provider visits (x/7), coach visits (x/16), days since provider visit, Vitality Score, and program stage.
     - **Timeline ribbon** visualization showing patient metrics over time.
     - **Validation Issues table** displaying unresolved issues for the patient with Severity, Metric, Current Value, Expected, Status, and Age.
     - **Vitals & Labs stacks** with small cards for each tracked vital showing last value and a sparkline of recent readings.
     - **Sidebar** with buttons linking to EHR, lab portal, scheduling, and a text area for waiver rationale.

2. **Improved Code Structure and Error Handling**  
   • Fixed missing `db_query` import that prevented patient detail view from rendering.
   • Added timestamp tracking for data refresh to give users feedback on data currency.
   • Simplified visualization handling for labs with tabular fallback for robustness.
   • Introduced new helper methods to enhance code organization and reusability:
     - `_get_patient_demographics`
     - `_compute_record_quality`
     - `_fetch_visit_metrics`
     - `_latest_vitality_score`
     - `_days_since`

3. **Record Quality Badge Implementation**
   • Created formula to calculate ratio of passed blocking rules (errors currently).
   • Implemented color coding: ≥95% green, 80-94% amber, <80% red.
   • Set up database queries to count active rules and failing rules per patient.

## Outstanding WS-7 Items (to carry forward)

1. **Action/Resolve UI Integration**
   • Implement the action buttons (Resolve/Waive) in the Validation Issues table.
   • Add form handling for waiver rationale capture with audit logging.

2. **Monthly Timeline Ribbon Enhancement**
   • Replace the current time-series plot with a monthly grid showing status icons.
   • Add hover tooltips with date and metric details.

3. **Card Border Highlighting**
   • Add red/amber border highlighting to vitals and labs cards based on validation status.

4. **Aggregate Quality-Metrics Dashboard**  
   – Build Panel view summarising error/warning counts by field + over time.

5. **Performance optimisation & unit-tests** for patient list refresh  
   – Cache or paginate; add timing regression test.

## Required Screenshot for Reference

For the next developer taking over this task, a screenshot of the Patient Data-Quality Dashboard has been attached in the task handoff channel, showing the current implementation state and visual design.
