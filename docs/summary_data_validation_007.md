# Data-Validation System – Sprint 06 Summary (2025-05-20)

## Highlights
* Dynamic patient-list refresh implemented via `patient_list_column` and `_refresh_patient_list()`.
* Filter changes now immediately update the UI and write a single INFO log line.
* Validation run no longer spams INFO logs – verbose vitals output moved to DEBUG.

## Remaining work
1. Unit-tests around `_refresh_patient_list` to lock behaviour and measure query time.
2. Add composite indices or materialised view if list refresh > 500 ms on production DB.
3. Spinner/loading indicator while refresh executes.
4. Finish "Quality metrics reporting" (WS-7 milestone).
