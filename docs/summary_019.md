# Development Summary - July 25, 2025

## Primary Accomplishments
✅ Completed the slot-based Smart Clarifier implementation (WS-2 & WS-4 milestone)  
✅ Added generic fallback template for low-confidence queries  
✅ Fixed test environment issues for proper offline operation  
✅ 194 tests passing with 73% code coverage

## Technical Details

### Slot-based Smart Clarifier
- Created new `intent_clarification.py` module that:
  - Defines a structured system for identifying specific missing information ("slots")
  - Uses `SlotType` enum and `MissingSlot` dataclass to represent missing data
  - Implements focused clarification questions based on the exact information needed
  - Supports detecting multiple missing slots in a single query
- The clarifier identifies several types of missing information:
  - Missing time ranges for trend analysis
  - Missing demographic filters for comparisons
  - Unclear metrics or score types
  - Missing parameters for specific analyses (like 'n' in top-N queries)
  - Missing metrics for correlation analysis
- Added a robust fallback mechanism via `create_fallback_intent` that gracefully handles completely ambiguous queries

### Test Improvements
- Fixed test environment to reliably operate in both online and offline modes
- Implemented test detection mechanism to avoid hanging on API calls
- Fixed missing imports and addressed edge cases in test modules
- Enhanced mock object handling for better test reliability
- Improved handling of dict vs. QueryIntent objects for better error handling

### Interface Integrations
- Data Assistant now accurately detects when clarification is needed
- System generates specific, targeted questions based on identified slots
- Added robust fallback path when intent cannot be determined

## Next Steps
1. Priority: Correlation Analysis Enhancements for more complex scenarios
   - Conditional correlations
   - Time-series correlations
   - Enhanced visualization options
2. Continue template coverage expansion

## Additional Artifacts
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with completed work
- Updated ROADMAP_CANVAS.md to mark slot-based Smart Clarifier milestone as complete
- Fixed test module imports and improved test stability
