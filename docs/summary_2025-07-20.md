# Daily Summary – 2025-07-20

## Context
Focus today was on housekeeping before chat hand-off: ensure documentation & roadmap reflect completion of the UI tooltip task and that tests remain green.

## Accomplishments
1. **Tooltip Hints Completed (WS-4)** – Saved-question buttons now include `title` attribute; verified via unit tests (`pytest` all green).
2. **ROADMAP_CANVAS.md Updated**
   • Added “Tooltip hints on saved-question buttons” as ✔ milestone under WS-4.  
   • Removed the corresponding backlog item to keep list ≤ 10.  
   • Bumped **Last updated** to 2025-07-20.
3. **CHANGELOG.md Entry** – Added ✅ item noting tooltip-hint feature completion.
4. **Test Run** – All tests pass (`pytest`), coverage unchanged (~81 %).

## Next Steps
1. Proceed with remaining backlog items (schema cache, logging MVP, Dockerfile).  
2. Begin ‘Intent engine hardening & template coverage’ under WS-2 (in-progress).
3. Optional: apply custom CSS for nicer tooltips if desired.
