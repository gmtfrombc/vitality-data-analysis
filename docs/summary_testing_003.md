# Continuous Feedback & Testing Summary 003

_Date: 2025-05-08_

## Overview

This summary documents significant enhancements to the VP Data Analysis application's Continuous Feedback & Evaluation Framework (WS-6). Two major features have been implemented:

1. **Composite Overall Score** - A weighted performance metric system providing an objective, at-a-glance assessment of the assistant's effectiveness
2. **Model Retraining Workflow** - An interactive process for analyzing negative feedback, generating improvement suggestions, and retraining the intent classifier

These implementations are part of the ongoing effort to create a robust feedback loop that enables continuous improvement of the assistant through human-in-the-loop guidance.

## Composite Overall Score Implementation

### Purpose
The composite score provides a single, numerical representation (0-100) of assistant performance, making it easier to:
- Track improvements over time
- Quantify the impact of changes
- Communicate overall performance to stakeholders
- Compare different versions or configurations

### Technical Implementation

1. **Score Calculation Formula**
   ```python
   score = (
       0.4 * satisfaction_rate
       + 0.2 * (1 - clarification_rate)
       + 0.2 * visualized_satisfaction
       + 0.2 * response_speed_score
   ) * 100
   ```

2. **Component Metrics**
   - **Satisfaction Rate** (40% weight) - Percentage of thumbs-up ratings
   - **Clarification Rate** (20% weight, inverted) - Lower values are better, indicating fewer clarifications needed
   - **Visualization Satisfaction** (20% weight) - User ratings for queries that include visualizations
   - **Response Speed** (20% weight) - Normalized response time (0ms → 1.0, ≥2000ms → 0.0)

3. **Database Storage**
   - The computed score is saved to the `assistant_metrics` table with:
     - `metric_type = 'overall'`
     - `metric_name = 'overall_score'`
   - The system maintains historical records for trend analysis

4. **UI Integration**
   - Added a prominent Number indicator at the top of the Evaluation Dashboard
   - Displays the current score with color bands (red < 70 < orange < 85 < green)
   - Shows previous score in brackets for quick comparison
   - Includes a "Recompute Score" button for on-demand recalculation

### Usage
- The score is calculated for the most recent 7-day period by default
- Users can trigger recalculation at any time via the dashboard button
- Scores are displayed in the format: "85.7% (80.2% prev)"
- Scores are persisted, enabling historical tracking and trend analysis

## Model Retraining Workflow

### Purpose
The model retraining workflow provides a structured, interactive process to:
- Identify common issues from user feedback
- Generate actionable suggestions for improving the assistant
- Update templates and default assumptions
- Retrain the intent classifier with the approved changes

### Technical Implementation

1. **Feedback Analysis**
   - The system extracts thumbs-down feedback from the `assistant_feedback` table
   - It applies heuristic analysis to identify metrics with potential issues
   - Common patterns trigger suggested improvements (e.g., clarifying default assumptions)

2. **Interactive CLI**
   - The operator reviews each suggestion with context about the metric and rationale
   - For each suggestion, the operator can:
     - Approve (implements the change as suggested)
     - Modify (changes the suggestion before implementation)
     - Decline (skips implementation)

3. **Training Data Management**
   - Approved suggestions generate synthetic training examples in JSONL format
   - The examples are appended to `data/intent_training_data.jsonl`
   - This incremental approach ensures the model improves over time without losing prior knowledge

4. **Intent Classifier Retraining**
   - A lightweight scikit-learn classifier is trained on the updated dataset
   - The model uses TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression
   - The trained model is saved to `models/intent_classifier.pkl`
   - The model serves as a fallback when GPT-4 is unavailable or as an ensemble signal

5. **Template Change Queue**
   - Approved template changes are added to `docs/template_change_queue.md`
   - This creates a record for developers to review and implement

6. **Reporting**
   - A daily report is generated documenting:
     - Number of feedback entries analyzed
     - Suggestions presented and decisions made
     - Training and model performance metrics

### Usage Workflow

1. The operator runs `python model_retraining.py` from the terminal
2. They review each suggestion and approve, modify, or decline
3. After completion, the script automatically:
   - Updates the training data
   - Retrains the intent classifier
   - Records template change suggestions
   - Generates a summary report
4. The operator runs tests to verify that changes don't break existing functionality
5. Changes are committed to version control

## Integration with Broader Testing Strategy

These enhancements integrate with the existing testing framework:

1. **Daily Workflow Integration**
   - `docs/Graeme's_Daily_Workflow.md` updated to include:
     - Model retraining process
     - Post-retraining regression testing
     - Version control guidance

2. **Regression Testing**
   - After retraining, operators run:
     - Fast smoke tests: `pytest -m smoke`
     - Full test suite: `pytest`
     - Golden Self-Test: `./run_self_test.sh` 

3. **Performance Assessment**
   - The Overall Score provides immediate feedback on whether changes are improving the system
   - Historical metrics help identify longer-term trends

## Next Steps

1. **Fine-tuning Dataset Creation**
   - Collect and curate training examples into a comprehensive dataset
   - Convert to format suitable for fine-tuning larger models

2. **Enhanced AI-Driven Testing**
   - Implement automatic generation of test cases based on identified failure patterns
   - Expand the synthetic test dataset to cover more edge cases

3. **A/B Testing Framework**
   - Develop capability to compare different clarification approaches
   - Implement statistical significance testing for feature changes

## Conclusion

The implementation of the Composite Overall Score and Model Retraining Workflow represents a significant advancement in the Continuous Feedback & Evaluation capabilities of the VP Data Analysis application. These features create a structured approach to measuring performance and implementing improvements based on user feedback.

By combining objective metrics with a human-in-the-loop improvement process, the system can evolve in response to real-world usage while maintaining reliability and consistency. The groundwork is now in place for more advanced feedback-driven improvements in the future.
