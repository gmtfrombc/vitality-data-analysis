Patched DataAnalysisAssistant to safely attach raw_query, preventing AttributeError and restoring passing tests. Updated CHANGELOG and added daily summary doc to reflect the fix. Ran formatting hooks and pushed commit with all tests green.
Fixed a regression that broke four unit tests and caused the assistant to crash when setting a non-existent `raw_query` attribute on the parsed `QueryIntent`.  The fix adds a small `try/except` guard in two spots of `DataAnalysisAssistant`, restoring graceful handling when the intent object is a dict or a frozen Pydantic model.  All 17 tests now pass (`pytest -q`).  Changelog updated with the new entry. 
Hardened sandbox with import whitelist and 3-second timeout, blocking unsafe code while preserving functionality. Expanded deterministic code templates to support median, distribution histograms, and monthly trend aggregations, all covered by new unit tests that lift branch coverage to 72 %. Updated docs and enforced a 60 % coverage gate, giving the next assistant a secure, well-tested foundation.
