# Daily Summary – 2025-05-22

Implemented security & analytics enhancements:

• Hardened sandbox with import whitelist + 3-second execution timeout; added dedicated timeout unit test.
• Expanded deterministic code templates to cover median aggregates, 10-bin distributions, and monthly trends (AVG per YYYY-MM).
• Coverage gate (60 %) now enforced via `.coveragerc`; suite sits at 72 % with 23 tests.
• Updated README and ARCHITECTURE docs; CHANGELOG entries appended.

Next assistant: focus on UI auto-visualisation (histogram bars + trend line chart) and refine intent parsing for multi-metric queries.
