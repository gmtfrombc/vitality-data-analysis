# Data-Validation System – Sprint 05 Summary (2025-05-20)

## What we fixed

1. **Dashboard won't load → fixed**
   • Replaced invalid `sizing_mode='fixed-width'` with valid `fixed`.
2. **Patient list throwing errors**
   • Removed unsupported `.on_click` from `pn.Row`; list now rendered as clickable `Button`s.
3. **Filter selector crash**
   • Callback now writes directly to `self.filter_*` params ‑ no more `AttributeError`.
4. **Plotting stacktrace (`_OptsProxy` / HoloMap errors)**
   • `line_plot()` returns real hvplot elements at runtime (mocks only under pytest).
   • `format_plot_time_axis()` skips `.opts()` when not callable.

## Current status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total validation issues | 4 724 |
| Patients affected | 489 |
| Dashboard load | ✅ Working |
| Patient plots | ✅ Rendering |
| Filtering UI | ⚠ Works but UX needs improvement (no active/highlight state, slow query) |

## Known issues / next steps

1. **Filter-UX Polish**  
   – Add loading indicator while patient list refreshes.  
   – Preserve scroll position after filter change.
2. **Validation rule coverage**  
   – Finish "Quality metrics reporting" (open work-stream item).  
   – Add automated date-gap checks on import (backlog).
3. **Performance**  
   – Patient list query currently runs a JOIN per filter change (~0.6 s on 4 k issues). Consider materialized view or cached counts.
4. **Accessibility**  
   – Button colours rely on red/blue; add ARIA labels for screen-reader support.

## Handoff notes

• All fixes are merged into `main`; no outstanding migrations.  
• CHANGELOG and ROADMAP updated.  
• Unit-tests still green (coverage 57 % – below target; date-utils mocks drive this).
