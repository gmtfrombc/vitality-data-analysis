# Sprint 0.15 – Data-Validation Hardening & Mock-DB Parity

_Date:_ 2025-05-11

## What we set out to do
* Close the schema gap between the synthetic **mock_patient_data.db** and production **patient_data.db** so tests mirror reality.
* Eliminate lingering environment-variable inconsistencies that caused pages to open the wrong database.
* Stabilise the Data-Validation UI for human-in-the-loop (HITL) testing.

## Key accomplishments
| Area | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| Mock DB | • Added **mental_health**, **pmh**, **patient_visit_metrics** and eight system tables.<br>• All column names, `NOT NULL` constraints and unique indexes now match production.<br>• Regenerated 20-patient cohort with realistic vitals, scores, labs, visit metrics and validation_rules (41). |
| Env override | Single helper `db_query.get_db_path()` now respected app-wide. `export MH_DB_PATH=...` switches datasets for all pages & tests. |
| Dashboard | Fixed total-patient count and stats when mock DB in use. |
| Data-Validation UI | • Handles alphanumeric IDs (`SP001`).<br>• Patient-row highlight bug resolved.<br>• Quality-metrics reporting complete (field & date trend plots). |
| Tests | • `test_db_path_override.py` verifies env-var override.<br>• Synthetic self-test extended (height, unit, mental_health, pmh). 100 % pass. |
| Docs & tooling | • Updated CHANGELOG & ROADMAP.<br>• `create_mock_db.py` auto-adds repo root to `sys.path`; `--overwrite` flag regenerates DB. |

## Metrics
* Unit-test coverage: _unchanged_ 71 % (threshold 60 %).
* Synthetic self-test: 10/10 tests passing.
* Mock DB creation time: **< 0.5 s** (20 patients, 500+ rows).

## Outstanding risks / next steps
1. _Performance optimisation for patient list refresh_ (WS-7 🔄) – hit 600 ms with 20 patients; will address caching & pagination for real dataset (~700 patients).
2. Docker packaging (WS-5) remains open; will be picked up in infra sprint.
3. Plan A/B framework for clarification approaches (WS-6 backlog).

## Unreleased CHANGELOG (excerpt)

⚡️ Enhancement: Added GitHub Actions CI workflow with test coverage validation (60% threshold)
✅ Test: Added unit tests for rule_loader duplicate handling and date normalization utilities
✨ Feature: Refactored date normalization into reusable helper `normalize_date_series` for consistent date formatting
🧪 Test: Added validation engine deep checks testing various rule types including categorical
🛠️ Fix: Fixed test coverage on core utilities that handle date normalization and validation
⚡️ Enhancement: Added Health Scores table to display Vitality Score and Heart Fit Score data alongside visit information
🐛 Fix: Normalized date formatting in Health Scores table to prevent duplicate entries due to inconsistent date formats
🐛 Fix: Fixed issue with NaN dates appearing in Health Scores table by implementing regex-based date extraction
✨ Feature: Patient Data-Quality Dashboard implemented with record quality badge, status tiles, timeline ribbon, issue table, and vitals/labs cards
🐛 Fix: Fixed missing `db_query` import in data_validation.py to enable patient detail view functionality
⚡️ Enhancement: Added timestamp tracking for data refresh to provide user feedback on data currency
⚡️ Enhancement: Simplified visualization handling for labs with tabular fallback for robustness
✨ Feature: Validation engine now supports `not_null_check` and `allowed_values_check` (categorical) with central dispatch
⚡️ Enhancement: `seed_validation_rules.py` converts frequency rows with `0`/`not_null` to presence rules (`not_null_check`)
⚡️ Enhancement: Data-Validation UI adds `categorical_check` filter option
⚡️ Enhancement: Snackbar notifications show when validation starts/completes; error toast on failure
⚡️ Enhancement: Patient list buttons now display `patient_id` prefix for quick identification
🛑 Change: Insurance & provider spring fields temporarily skipped via `SKIPPED_FIELDS` until UI support
🐛 Fix: Replaced invalid `sizing_mode='fixed-width'` with `fixed` in Data-Validation UI
🐛 Fix: Removed unsupported `.on_click` on `pn.Row`; patient list now uses interactive buttons
🐛 Fix: AttributeError in filter callback resolved by assigning parameters directly
🐛 Fix: Runtime plots now use real hvplot; safeguarded `.opts` call – resolves `_OptsProxy` errors
⚡️ Enhancement: Data-Validation dashboard loads correctly; patient filtering UI operational (needs refinement)
🐛 Fix: Resolved timezone-aware datetime comparison issues in validation system
🐛 Fix: Improved NaT handling and date parsing in data validation system
🐛 Fix: Fixed Panel widget parameter naming conflicts in data validation UI
