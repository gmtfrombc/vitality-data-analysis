# Data Validation Update 013: Health Scores Table Implementation

**Date:** 2025-05-10  
**Author:** AI Assistant

## Overview
This update adds a new Health Scores table to the Data Validation panel. The table displays Vitality Score and Heart Fit Score data from the scores table, placed alongside the Provider Visits and Health Coach Visits tables in the timeline section.

## Key Changes

### 1. Added Health Scores Table
- Created a new `create_scores_table()` method in the `DataValidationPage` class
- Implemented filtering to show only `vitality_score` and `heart_fit_score` data
- Added the new table to the timeline row layout alongside Provider and Health Coach visit tables

### 2. Date Format Standardization
- Implemented date normalization to ensure consistent YYYY-MM-DD format
- Added regex-based date extraction to handle various date formats
- Fixed an issue with NaN dates appearing in the display by dropping rows with invalid dates
- Implemented deduplication to ensure only one score value per date and score type is shown

### 3. User Interface Improvements
- Ensured all three tables have consistent height (250px)
- Standardized column naming with proper title case
- Maintained consistent section header styling
- Added appropriate fallback messages when no scores are available

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation uses a robust date normalization process:
1. Extract YYYY-MM-DD pattern from date strings using regex
2. Apply fallback extraction for formats not matching the primary pattern
3. Drop any rows with dates that couldn't be parsed
4. Remove duplicates while keeping the newest entries
5. Sort by date in descending order (newest first)

The new table maintains visual consistency with the other tables in the timeline view and integrates seamlessly with the patient data validation workflow.

## Next Steps
- Add unit tests for the date normalization functionality
- Consider adding trend visualizations for scores over time
- Explore options to reduce horizontal scrolling when all three tables are displayed

This enhancement completes the "Health scores data table" milestone in Work Stream 7 (Data Quality & Validation).

## Unreleased CHANGELOG (excerpt)

⚡️ Enhancement: Added Health Scores table to display Vitality Score and Heart Fit Score data alongside visit information
🐛 Fix: Normalized date formatting in Health Scores table to prevent duplicate entries due to inconsistent date formats
🐛 Fix: Fixed issue with NaN dates appearing in Health Scores table by implementing regex-based date extraction
✨ Feature: Patient Data-Quality Dashboard implemented with record quality badge, status tiles, timeline ribbon, issue table, and vitals/labs cards
🐛 Fix: Fixed missing `db_query` import in data_validation.py to enable patient detail view functionality
⚡️ Enhancement: Added timestamp tracking for data refresh to provide user feedback on data currency
⚡️ Enhancement: Simplified visualization handling for labs with tabular fallback for robustness
✨ Feature: Validation engine now supports `not_null_check` and `allowed_values_check` (categorical) with central dispatch
⚡️ Enhancement: `seed_validation_rules.py` converts frequency rows with `0`/`not_null` to presence rules (`not_null_check`)
⚡️ Enhancement: Data-Validation UI adds `categorical_check` filter option
