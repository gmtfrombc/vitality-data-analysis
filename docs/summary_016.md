# Daily Summary – Session 016

## Context
Moving forward on WS-6 (Continuous Feedback & Evaluation) we implemented the first iteration of query/response logging so real-world usage can be analysed and fed back into model improvements.

## What was done today
1. **Database migration**
   • Added `migrations/006_add_assistant_logs_table.sql` creating `assistant_logs` (+ index).
2. **Logging helper**
   • New module `app/utils/query_logging.py` with `log_interaction()` and `fetch_recent()`.
   • Auto-creates table when running against a fresh DB (test convenience).
3. **UI integration**
   • `DataAnalysisAssistant` now captures start/stop timestamps and calls `log_interaction()` after final results.
4. **Unit test**
   • Added `tests/utils/test_query_logging.py` ensuring a row is written & retrievable.
5. **Bug fix**
   • Removed duplicate `import time` inside loop to resolve `UnboundLocalError` in smoke tests.
6. **Documentation**
   • ROADMAP_CANVAS marked *Query/response logging MVP* as ✔ and updated **Last updated**.
   • CHANGELOG entry added.

## Test & Coverage
• Full suite: 186 tests, all green; coverage 74 % (> 60 % gate).

## Next Steps
