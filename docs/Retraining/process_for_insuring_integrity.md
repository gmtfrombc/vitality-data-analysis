Yes, you can (and should) use Cursor Assistant to review and edit the training data file (`intent_training_data.jsonl`) to fix mistakes and check for inconsistencies.

### **Recommended Process for Assuring Model Integrity**

1. **Periodic Review**
   - Ask Cursor Assistant to scan `scripts/data/intent_training_data.jsonl` for:
     - Duplicate, contradictory, or inconsistent entries.
     - Obvious mistakes (e.g., wrong labels, typos, accidental approvals).
   - Request a summary of potential issues and suggested corrections.

2. **Manual Edits**
   - Use Cursor Assistant to:
     - Remove or correct problematic entries.
     - Standardize formatting and labeling.
     - Validate that all examples are relevant and accurate.

3. **Version Control**
   - Commit changes to the training data file with clear commit messages.
   - Optionally, keep a backup before major edits.

4. **Retrain the Model**
   - After editing, rerun `model_retraining.py` to regenerate `intent_classifier.pkl` with the clean data.

5. **Test the Model**
   - Optionally, add or run test queries to verify the modelâ€™s behavior after retraining.

**Summary:**  
- Use Cursor Assistant for regular audits and edits.
- Keep the training data file clean and consistent.
- Retrain and test after changes.
