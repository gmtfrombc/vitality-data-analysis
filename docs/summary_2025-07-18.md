# Daily Summary – 2025-07-18

## Context
Today we focused on validating the functionality of the application's main run script and assessing the dynamic code generation sandbox that was implemented earlier. This completes a key milestone in the WS-2 Hybrid AI Engine work stream.

## Accomplishments

### Application Run Script Validation
1. Analyzed `run.py` which serves as the main entry point for the application
2. Verified that the application launches correctly with all pages properly loaded
3. Confirmed robust error handling and resource cleanup in shutdown procedures
4. Identified appropriate testing strategies for the script including:
   - Testing `create_app()` functionality
   - Testing resource cleanup routines
   - Testing signal handling for graceful termination
   - Testing error handling during startup

### Dynamic Code Generation Sandbox Verification
1. Confirmed that the dynamic code generation sandbox is working correctly
2. Verified support for complex query types:
   - Trend analysis with time ranges
   - Distribution analysis for visualizing data patterns
   - Comparison analysis between patient groups
3. Observed successful execution of generated code through the sandbox
4. Marked the WS-2 "Dynamic code generation sandbox" milestone as complete in the roadmap

### Test Coverage Assessment
1. Verified that overall test coverage remains at 75% (well above the 60% threshold)
2. Confirmed all tests are passing without errors
3. The golden query harness successfully processes all test cases (>30 canonical questions)

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing suggested tests for run.py to further improve coverage
2. Address remaining backlog items:
   - Refactor plotting utilities into `plots.py` (#code-health)
   - Draft minimal Dockerfile & GH Action (#devops)
   - Add tooltip hints to saved-question buttons (#design)
3. Continue with planned UX improvements in the WS-4 work stream

## Lessons Learned
1. The dynamic code generation sandbox provides a robust way to handle uncommon query types
2. Strong test coverage is crucial for confidence in application stability
3. Having a clear roadmap has helped track progress and prioritize effort effectively
