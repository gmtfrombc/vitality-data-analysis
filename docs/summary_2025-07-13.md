# Daily Summary – 2025-07-13

## Context
Building on our recent progress with the auto-visualization mapper and feedback collection, we focused on enhancing the assistant's capability to understand and process date-specific queries. Date range filtering is essential for time-series analysis in clinical settings where tracking metrics like weight, BMI, or blood pressure over specific periods provides valuable insights into patient progress.

## What was done today
1. **Enhanced Query Intent Model (WS-2)** 
   • Added `DateRange` class with validation for standardized date range handling
   • Extended `Filter` class with `date_range` field for field-specific date filters
   • Added global `time_range` field to `QueryIntent` for query-wide date filtering
   • Implemented helper methods: `has_date_filter()` and `get_date_range()`

2. **Improved AI Helper**
   • Enhanced system prompt with date range handling instructions and examples
   • Added post-processing heuristics to detect date ranges from natural language
   • Implemented month name recognition and conversion to standardized date formats

3. **Enhanced SQL Generation**
   • Updated `_build_code_from_intent` to handle date ranges in all query templates
   • Added proper date formatting for SQL compatibility
   • Implemented table-specific date column mapping (using `date` or `program_start_date` depending on table)

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   • Added unit tests for `DateRange` model validation
   • Added unit tests for `QueryIntent` with time ranges
   • Added SQL generation tests for date filtering
   • Added a golden test for time series analysis with date ranges
   • Fixed existing tests to accommodate the new fields

5. **Documentation Updates**
   • Updated CHANGELOG.md to document the date range filtering implementation
   • Updated ROADMAP_CANVAS.md to mark the date range filtering milestone as complete
   • Created this summary document to capture the changes and future directions

## Next incremental steps
| Step | Description | PR Target |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Multi-metric correlation analysis enhancements | **backend** |
   • Enhance query intent parsing for multi-variable relationships
   • Add correlation coefficient calculations between metrics
   • Create scatter plot visualizations for metric pairs
   • Add specialized SQL templates for joined multi-metric queries
   • Implement test cases for common clinical correlations (e.g., weight vs. BMI)
| 2 | Percent-change visualization improvements | **visualisation** |
| 3 | Multi-user support for saved questions | **backend** |
| 4 | Dockerization and CI/CD setup | **devops** |

## Benefits and Impact
The date range filtering capability significantly enhances the 'ask anything' assistant's ability to answer time-focused clinical questions. Users can now naturally ask questions like "Show me weight trends from January to March" or "What was the average BMI in April 2024?" without having to manually filter data.

This feature is particularly valuable in a metabolic health context where tracking changes over specific time periods is crucial for assessing program effectiveness, seasonal variations, or intervention impacts.
