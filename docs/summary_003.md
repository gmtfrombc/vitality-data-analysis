# Daily Summary – Session 003

## What we did ✅
1. **Happy-path integration test added**  
   • *tests/smoke/test_happy_path_average.py* covers query → intent → code → sandbox exec for an *average weight* scenario.  
   • Mocks LLM and DB, runs offline, asserts scalar result.  
2. **Roadmap update**  
   • Marked *Unit test coverage ≥ 60 %* and *Intent classification API* milestones as complete.  
   • Removed completed backlog item *Implement get_query_intent*.  
3. **Meta**  
   • `ROADMAP_CANVAS.md` last-updated timestamp bumped to 2025-05-03.

## Next up ▶️
- Expand integration tests to cover histogram and trend templates.  
- Begin refactor: extract plot helpers into `app/utils/plots.py`.  
- Plan migration of saved-questions to SQLite (design schema).
