# Daily Summary – 2025-07-09

## Context
We attempted to move *saved questions* storage from a JSON file to SQLite inside `app/pages/data_assistant.py`. The large diff caused duplication and syntax issues, so we decided to roll the UI file back to its last good version and keep the new helper module isolated.

## What was done today
1. **Roadmap updated**  
   • Added *Automated JSON → SQLite update pipeline* milestone under WS-3.
2. **SQLite groundwork**  
   • Created `app/utils/saved_questions_db.py` with load / save / upsert / delete helpers and table-creation DDL.
3. **Rollback & green tests**  
   • Reverted `app/pages/data_assistant.py` to JSON implementation.  
   • Test suite passes (61 tests, 65 % coverage).
4. **Changelog**  
   • Added entry for today's work.

## Next incremental steps for SQLite migration
| Step | Description | PR Target |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Add unit tests for `saved_questions_db.py` (happy path + error cases) | **WS-3-A** |
| 2 | Inject helper into `DataAnalysisAssistant` **read-only** (load at init) – keep writes on JSON | **WS-3-B** |
| 3 | Swap "Save / Delete Question" actions to call `upsert_question` / `delete_question` | **WS-3-C** |
| 4 | Remove JSON fallback & delete legacy file after burn-in | **WS-3-D** |

## Outstanding tasks / backlog
- Write `tests/utils/test_saved_questions_db.py` (Step 1).  
- Auto-visualisation mapper (WS-4, in-progress).  
- Dockerfile + GitHub Action draft.
