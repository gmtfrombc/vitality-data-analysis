# Summary: Data Validation System Implementation - May 6, 2025

Today marks the beginning of a new initiative in the Metabolic Health Program: implementing a robust data validation and correction system. This feature aims to address the challenge of missing, inaccurate, or inconsistent patient data that naturally occurs during clinical data collection.

## Implemented Components

1. **Database Schema**
   - Created migration `008_data_validation_tables.sql` with four new tables:
     - `validation_rules`: Stores rule definitions and parameters
     - `validation_results`: Tracks identified data issues
     - `data_corrections`: Records corrections made to patient data
     - `correction_audit`: Maintains an audit trail of all actions

2. **Validation Engine**
   - Implemented `ValidationEngine` class in `app/utils/validation_engine.py`:
     - Core rule execution logic
     - Patient data retrieval
     - Issue detection and reporting
     - Support for frequency and range validation checks

3. **Rule Management**
   - Created `app/utils/rule_loader.py` for loading rules from JSON
   - Added initial set of rules in `data/validation_rules.json` covering:
     - Measurement frequency checks for BMI, weight, blood pressure, and A1C
     - Range validation for common vital measurements

4. **User Interface**
   - Developed Panel-based UI in `app/pages/data_validation.py` with:
     - Dashboard summarizing validation issues
     - Patient list with issue counts
     - Patient timeline visualization
     - Issue review and correction interface

5. **System Integration**
   - Updated `run.py` to initialize validation system on startup
   - Added "Data Validation" tab to main application
   - Created startup sequence in `app/utils/validation_startup.py`

6. **Project Documentation**
   - Added Data Validation initiative to ROADMAP_CANVAS.md (WS-7)
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with validation system progress
   - Created detailed design document in `docs/DATA_VALIDATION.md`

## Validation Rule Types Implemented

1. **Missing Data Rules**: Identify measurements not taken at expected intervals
   - Example: Weight should be recorded every 60 days
   - Example: A1C should be measured every 90 days

2. **Range Validation Rules**: Detect physiologically implausible values
   - Example: BMI values should be between 15-70
   - Example: Systolic BP values should be between 70-250 mmHg

## User Workflows

The current implementation supports three main user workflows:

1. **Data Quality Overview**: Dashboard view of all validation issues
2. **Patient Review**: Timeline-based view of a specific patient's data
3. **Data Correction**: Interface for fixing issues and tracking changes

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test with actual patient data
   - Refine validation rules based on clinical feedback
   - Add unit tests for validation engine

2. **Enhanced Rule Types**
   - Implement consistency rules (cross-field validation)
   - Add trend-based validation (identify unlikely changes)
   - Support custom rule creation through UI

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Add batch correction capabilities
   - Implement validation result export
   - Create reporting dashboard for tracking progress

4. **Integration With Data Import**
   - Run validation automatically during patient data import
   - Add validation summary to import panel

## Technical Considerations

- The validation engine is designed to be extensible, allowing new rule types to be added easily
- All corrections are tracked with detailed audit information
- The UI is physician-friendly, focusing on clinical workflow rather than technical details
- The system supports both individual and batch validation operations

This implementation provides a foundation for improving data quality in the Metabolic Health Program, which will become increasingly important as the dataset grows beyond the current ~600 patients.
