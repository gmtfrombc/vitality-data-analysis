# Metabolic Health Program - Development Planning (2025-05-07)

## Overview
Today we designed an enhanced Continuous Feedback & Evaluation System that combines automated AI-driven testing with human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms. This system will help objectively measure and improve the Data Analysis Assistant's performance through targeted metrics and systematic analysis of query patterns.

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Assistant Evaluation Framework
- **Query Understanding Metrics** for measuring intent classification accuracy, clarification efficiency, and slot identification rate
- **Analysis Quality Metrics** to evaluate statistical validity, code quality, and visualization appropriateness
- **User Experience Metrics** tracking time-to-answer, feedback positivity, and clarification relevance

### 2. Enhanced Self-Test Loop
- Expand the existing Synthetic "Golden-Dataset" Self-Test Loop with AI-driven test case generation
- Implement learning mechanisms to identify challenging query patterns
- Create automated analysis of clarification effectiveness
- Build a systematic approach for comparing query variations

### 3. UI Feedback Components
- Add lightweight feedback widgets on results and clarification screens
- Include simple rating options (thumbs up/down) with optional comments
- Implement "suggest better clarification" options for improvement
- Collect real-time feedback during actual usage

### 4. Performance Dashboard
- Create visualization of performance trends over time
- Track improvements across all metrics categories
- Generate weekly summary reports
- Provide drill-down capability for detailed analysis

### 5. A/B Testing Framework
- Compare different clarification approaches systematically
- Test variations in code generation templates
- Evaluate visualization effectiveness across query types
- Measure performance impact of system changes

## Technical Approach
We'll build these enhancements on top of the existing infrastructure, including:
- The completed Synthetic "Golden-Dataset" Self-Test Loop
- The assistant_feedback table and query/response logging
- The slot-based Smart Clarifier system
- The statistical templates already implemented

This development will focus on both objective measurement and continuous improvement mechanisms, creating a virtuous feedback loop where the assistant grows more capable with each interaction.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the lightweight UI feedback widget
2. Create the metrics tracking system
3. Enhance the Self-Test Loop with AI-driven test generation
4. Build the performance dashboard
5. Develop the A/B testing framework

## Expected Outcomes
- More targeted and relevant clarification questions
- Improved ability to handle complex queries
- Systematic identification and resolution of weaknesses
- Objective measurement of assistant performance
- Data-driven improvement process
