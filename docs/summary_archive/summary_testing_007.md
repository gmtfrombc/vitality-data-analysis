# Summary Testing 007: Sandbox Fixes & Clinical Reference Ranges

**Date**: May 8, 2025  
**Author**: AI Assistant  
**Focus**: Resolving sandbox execution failures and implementing clinical reference ranges

## Summary
This sprint resolved persistent issues with the sandbox execution system and enhanced clinical context in responses by implementing a standard reference range system. The two key deliverables were:

1. Fixed syntax errors in the reference ranges display code that was causing test failures
2. Created a dedicated system for providing standard clinical reference ranges in responses

## Sandbox Execution Fixes

### Issue
The data assistant was experiencing execution failures in the sandbox, particularly when running BP vs A1C comparisons. The root causes were:
- Syntax errors in the reference ranges display code block causing Python parse errors
- Uninitialized `results` variable when fallback paths were triggered
- Inconsistent indentation in the reference ranges section

### Solution
1. Corrected syntax and indentation in the reference ranges block of the `_display_execution_results` method
2. Ensured the `results` dictionary is properly initialized in both implementations of the BP vs A1C comparison code
3. Added proper error handling to prevent NameError exceptions

### Impact
- All automated tests now pass successfully
- The BP vs A1C comparison query now works reliably, even when falling back to the rule engine
- The system gracefully handles execution failures with proper error messages

## Clinical Reference Ranges Implementation

### Enhancement
Added a comprehensive system for storing and displaying standard clinical reference ranges to provide better context in answers:

1. Created `data/metric_reference.yaml` with standard ranges for:
   - A1C (normal: ≤5.6%, high: ≥6.5%)
   - Systolic BP (normal: 90-120 mmHg)
   - Diastolic BP (normal: 60-80 mmHg) 
   - PHQ9 score (normal/mild/moderate/severe ranges)
   - GAD7 score (normal/mild/moderate/severe ranges)

2. Implemented `app/utils/metric_reference.py` helper that:
   - Loads and caches reference ranges from YAML
   - Provides an easy-to-use API for accessing ranges

3. Enhanced the UI to display reference ranges in query results
   - Added a "Reference Ranges" section to relevant query results
   - Properly formatted range displays with clear labeling

4. Updated the LLM prompt template in `interpret_results` to:
   - Instruct the AI to incorporate reference ranges in responses
   - Provide clinical context by explaining normal vs. abnormal values

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `app/pages/data_assistant.py`: Fixed syntax errors in reference range display
- `app/utils/metric_reference.py`: Added new helper for reference ranges
- `data/metric_reference.yaml`: Created new file with clinical reference data
- `app/ai_helper.py`: Updated system prompt to include reference range context

### Implementation Notes
- Reference data is cached using `@functools.lru_cache` for performance
- The system uses a YAML format to make future updates to ranges easier
- All reference ranges are displayed with proper units (%, mmHg, score)

## Next Steps
1. Extend reference ranges to include all clinical metrics in the database
2. Add admin interface for clinical staff to update reference ranges
3. Implement automated validation that all reported metrics include reference ranges where available

## Conclusion
This implementation addresses an urgent bug in the sandbox execution system while also improving the clinical value of responses by providing standardized reference ranges. By clearly explaining what values are normal vs. abnormal, the application now provides better context for clinical decision-making.
