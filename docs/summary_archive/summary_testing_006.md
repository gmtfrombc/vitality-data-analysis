## Summary – Testing Cycle 006 (2025-05-11)

Key focus: addressing sandbox execution failures and BP-vs-A1C fallback accuracy.

### Highlights

- 🔧 **Sandbox hardening**
  - Added relative-import allowance and internal `subprocess` stub to appease hvplot/bokeh imports.
  - Introduced early exit for built-ins (`sys`, `types`, `inspect`) to break recursion caused by stub creation.
- 🐛 **UI safeguards**
  - Guarded `DataAnalysisAssistant._display_execution_results` against missing `intermediate_results` preventing attribute errors after sandbox failure.
- 🐛 **Data query robustness**
  - A1C retrieval queries now case-insensitive; auto-fallback to `scores` table when `lab_results` empty.

### Remaining Issues

1. **Sandbox Execution Failure** – Certain dynamic snippets still raise exceptions; fallback rule triggers but returns `NameError: results`.
2. **Rule-Engine Fallback** – Intended BP-vs-A1C comparison rule not producing correct answer due to missing `results` object.

### Next Steps

- Initialise `results: dict|None` at start of dynamic snippet execution wrapper to guarantee scope availability.
- Confirm rule-engine correctly detects sandbox failure and injects fallback analysis code.
- Expand unit tests to cover failure-path resolution and BP-vs-A1C output validation.
