# Data-Validation System – Sprint 10 Summary (2025-05-07)

## Key Improvements

1. **Rule Engine Extension (categorical & presence)**  
   * Added `not_null_check` and `allowed_values_check` logic with central dispatch.  
   * Frequency rules with `0` / `not_null` automatically convert to presence checks during CSV → YAML seeding.

2. **UI & UX Enhancements**  
   * Snackbar notifications inform users when validation starts / completes or fails.  
   * Patient buttons now include `patient_id` for quick reference.  
   * Rule-type filter list expanded to include `categorical_check`.

3. **Admin & Dev Tools**  
   * `SKIPPED_FIELDS` allows temporary suppression of insurance/provider rules until interface exists.  
   * CHANGELOG and ROADMAP updated; new milestones recorded.

## Remaining WS-7 Items

* Quality-metrics reporting (aggregate dashboard) – still in progress.  
* Performance optimisation & unit-tests for patient list refresh.

## Next Steps (agreed)

1. Investigate inconsistent application of `rule_type` values in `validation_results`.  
2. Draft test harness to reproduce mis-typing and add regression tests.  
3. Begin implementation of quality metrics time-series dashboard.
