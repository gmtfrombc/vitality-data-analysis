# Data-Validation System – Sprint 09 Summary (2025-05-07)

## Key Improvements

1. **Admin Reload Rules Button**  
   * One-click seeding from `metric_catalogue.csv` → YAML → DB.  
   * Automatically re-validates all patients; success/error toast via Panel.

2. **UI / UX Polish**  
   * Selected patient row now highlighted (`button_type="primary"`) and auto-scroll to top.  
   * Patient list counts use `COUNT(DISTINCT rule_id)` so numbers reflect *unique* validation issues rather than raw rows.

3. **Rule Clean-up & De-duplication**  
   * Old centimetre-based height rule and legacy weight rules set `is_active = 0`.  
   * Validation engine suppresses weight range/frequency alerts when BMI already out-of-range.

4. **Validation Engine Hardening**  
   * Validation run purges previous results before re-run to avoid stale issues.  
   * Weight frequency rule skipped entirely to prevent redundancy.

## Remaining WS-7 Items

* Quality-metrics reporting (aggregate dashboard) – still in progress.  
* Performance optimisations & unit-tests for patient list refresh.

## Next Steps

1. Implement quality-metrics reporting view (daily snapshot, spark-lines).  
2. Add unit-tests for reload-rules path and UI button logic.  
3. Draft `DOCS/HANDOFF.md` – rolling one-pager summarising latest context for next AI assistant.
