# Sprint 0.16 – Data-Validation Improvements (2025-05-12)

**Theme:** Polish & Parity  
Focus on eliminating unit inconsistencies and ensuring narrative accuracy for scalar results while keeping the self-test harness green.

## What we accomplished

| Area | Item |
|------|------|
| Data Quality | Regenerated **mock_patient_data.db** with imperial units (lbs / in). |
| Stability | Removed heuristic kg→lbs conversion blocks from `db_query.py` – database now provides canonical units. |
| AI Engine | Narrative generator now detects metric type (average / sum / percent-change / count) to prevent mis-labeling. |
| UI | Warnings about "count as average" eliminated; average-weight query reports ~192 lbs with correct summary. |
| Roadmap | Added milestone "Scalar-metric narrative handling" to **WS-2** and pruned backlog to 10 open items. |
| Tests | All 250 pytest cases pass; coverage steady at 65 % (+0 %). |

## Next Up
1. Confidence-based follow-up & generic fallback template *(AI)*  
2. In-memory schema cache to speed up cold-start *(Perf)*  
3. Begin Dockerfile + CI publish pipeline *(DevOps)*
