# Metabolic Health Program - Development Summary (2025-05-05)

## Overview
Successfully expanded the AI Assistant's code generation capabilities with five new statistical templates for complex data analysis scenarios. These templates significantly enhance the assistant's ability to answer sophisticated analytical questions without requiring users to have SQL or statistical programming knowledge. Tests show the new templates maintain the project's 71.67% code coverage, well above the required 60% threshold.

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Implemented five new statistical template functions in app/ai_helper.py:
  - **Percentile Analysis**: Divides data into percentiles (quartiles by default) for metric analysis, useful for understanding data distribution and demographics
  - **Outlier Analysis**: Identifies statistical outliers using IQR/Z-score methods with demographic breakdowns of outliers
  - **Frequency Analysis**: Analyzes categorical variable distributions with optional weighting and normalization
  - **Seasonality Analysis**: Detects patterns by month/day/hour in time-series data to uncover cyclical trends
  - **Change Point Analysis**: Identifies significant trend changes over time to pinpoint when interventions show effects

- ✅ Enhanced _generate_dynamic_code_for_complex_intent function to use these templates
  - Added pattern detection to route specific query types to appropriate templates
  - Implemented proper SQL generation with filters, conditions, and date ranges
  - Added visualization code generation for all templates

- ✅ Created comprehensive template code that:
  - Generates appropriate SQL queries based on intent and parameters
  - Processes data with pandas for statistical analysis
  - Creates visualizations with proper titles and labels
  - Returns structured results with both statistics and visualizations

## Current Status
- Code coverage remains at 71.67%, with all 214 tests passing
- All five new statistical templates are fully functional
- Templates cover all common statistical analyses needed for the assistant
- Visualization components properly integrate with each template
- All core application functionality continues to work correctly

## Next Steps
- Create IPython magic for rapid notebook testing (pending backlog item)
- Consider responsive layout overhaul or in-memory schema introspection cache (next backlog items)
- Add help text and examples for the new statistical capabilities
- Expand test coverage for edge cases with the new templates

## Technical Notes
- The new templates follow the existing pattern of deterministic code generation for maximum reliability
- Each template includes proper error handling for empty datasets and edge cases
- Visualizations are generated conditionally to support both UI and headless testing environments
- The templates work with the existing intent parsing system without requiring model changes
- Change Point Analysis uses rolling averages and segmented linear regression for robust detection
