# Summary: Test Suite Fixes and Auto-Visualization Completion - May 5, 2025

## Overview
Today we finalized the Auto-Visualization Template Coverage implementation by fixing several test issues and ensuring the entire test suite passes with high coverage. These improvements have solidified the top-N visualization feature and enhanced the overall stability of the codebase.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Test Suite Fixes**:
   - Fixed sandbox import restrictions by adding 'textwrap' to the import whitelist in `app/utils/sandbox.py`
   - Fixed a KeyError issue in `tests/smoke/test_tricky_pipeline.py` by safely checking if the 'name' key exists
   - Added a name ('top5_ethnicities_program') to our new top-N visualization test in qa.yaml
   - Achieved 71.67% overall test coverage, well above the 60% requirement
   - All 211 tests now pass successfully (with only 1 skipped test that requires online integration)

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with our test fixes and improvements
   - Verified that ROADMAP_CANVAS.md correctly shows Template coverage as completed
   - Updated summary documentation to reflect recent changes

## Next Steps
With the test suite now fully functional and the Auto-Visualization Template Coverage milestone completed, we should focus on:

1. Implementing the Synthetic "Golden-Dataset" Self-Test Loop (QA task)
2. Continuing work on the Help & onboarding tour (WS-4)
3. Exploring deployment options with Docker (WS-5)

These fixes complete our work on the WS-2 Template Coverage task and provide a stable foundation for future features.
