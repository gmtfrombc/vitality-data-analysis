# Metabolic Health Program - Development Summary (Session 004)

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Synthetic "Golden-Dataset" Self-Test Loop with complete automation features. This system provides an automated quality assurance framework that validates the Data Analysis Assistant's functionality by testing it against a controlled dataset with known statistical properties. Additionally, created a comprehensive handoff system to streamline transitions between development sessions and maintain consistent documentation.

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Implemented Synthetic "Golden-Dataset" Self-Test Loop with 10 test cases
  - Created a controlled synthetic patient database generator
  - Added test cases covering various query types (counts, averages, correlations, trends)
  - Implemented a tolerant comparison system for numeric and visualization results
  - Added test reporting and history tracking
  - Added offline testing capabilities without relying on OpenAI API

- ✅ Created automated testing infrastructure
  - Developed nightly test script with desktop notifications via AppleScript
  - Added cron job setup helper for 11:00 PM scheduled tests
  - Implemented multiple notification methods for reliability
  - Added desktop log files for permanent record of test results

- ✅ Enhanced developer workflow
  - Created `handoff.sh` script for seamless transitions between assistant sessions
  - Added automatic documentation template creation
  - Integrated self-test validation into the handoff process
  - Updated README with comprehensive documentation on the new features

## Current Status
- Self-test status: PASSED (10/10 tests passing)
- All components of the Synthetic "Golden-Dataset" Self-Test Loop are complete and working
- Automated notifications are configured and verified working
- Documentation has been updated to reflect the new features

## Next Steps
- Expand test coverage with additional test cases for edge cases
- Integrate self-test results into a dashboard component
- Consider adding integration with GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- Begin work on responsive layout overhaul or in-memory schema introspection cache (next backlog items)

## Technical Notes
- The self-test system uses a dictionary-based keyword matching system to identify test cases when running in offline mode
- AppleScript alerts were found to be the most reliable notification method on macOS
- The framework is designed to work without external API dependencies, making it suitable for CI environments
- All test results are persisted in both the database and filesystem for historical tracking
- The handoff script ensures consistent documentation by creating templates and providing standardized instructions
