# Summary: Enhanced Correlation Analysis Implementation - July 26, 2025

## Overview
Today's work focused on enhancing the correlation analysis capabilities of the Metabolic Health Program's AI assistant. We implemented advanced correlation features including conditional correlations by demographic variables and time-series correlations to track relationship changes over time.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Advanced Correlation Module**:
   - Created `app/utils/advanced_correlation.py` with specialized functions for conditional and time-series correlations
   - Implemented visualization helpers for correlation heatmaps and time-series plots
   - Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/utils/test_advanced_correlation.py`

2. **AI Helper Integration**:
   - Updated `app/ai_helper.py` to support the new correlation types through the `_generate_correlation_code` function
   - Enhanced intent parsing to detect conditional and time-series correlation requests
   - Fixed string template issues in correlation code generation

3. **Data Assistant Updates**:
   - Enhanced `app/pages/data_assistant.py` to handle and display different types of correlation results
   - Updated result display to show conditional correlations by group and time-series correlations

4. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Created integration tests in `tests/golden/test_enhanced_correlation.py`
   - Fixed mock HoloViews implementation to avoid test failures
   - Achieved 72% test coverage, exceeding the 60% requirement

5. **Documentation**:
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md to reflect the enhanced correlation analysis features
   - Added the new QA self-test loop task to ROADMAP_CANVAS.md

## Next Steps
- Continue expanding template coverage for auto-visualization hooks
- Work on the QA self-test loop for daily regression testing
- Focus on the remaining high-priority items in the backlog
