# Data-Validation Sprint – Summary 011 (2025-05-07)

## What We Did in This Session

1. **Program-End-Date rule implemented**  
   • Added `conditional_not_null_check` logic to ValidationEngine.  
   • Updated YAML catalogue (`PROGRAM_END_DATE_FREQUENCY_CHECK`) to require a `program_end_date` when **(inactive) OR (provider_visit_count ≥ 7)**.  
   • Extended unit-test fixture; validation test now covers missing start-date, extreme BMI/weight, and the conditional end-date rule.

2. **Mock DB + Unit-Test framework**  
   • `tests/validation/test_engine_rules.py` builds a tiny SQLite DB with 4 patients (1 clean, 3 with known issues).  
   • Added `validation` pytest marker.  
   • Passing on functional level; coverage gate fails only when run in isolation (expected).

## Outstanding WS-7 Items (to carry forward)

1. **Aggregate Quality-Metrics Dashboard**  
   – Build Panel view summarising error/warning counts by field + over time.

2. **Performance optimisation & unit-tests** for patient list refresh  
   – Cache or paginate; add timing regression test.

3. **Clean up inconsistent `rule_type` values** in `validation_results`  
   – Write migration / normalisation script and add DB constraint.

(Stretch) Quick-fix UI for common categorical fields can wait until next sprint.

## How to Use the Mock DB Going Forward

```bash
export DATA_DB_PATH=data/mock_validation.db   # switch dashboard to mock data
panel serve run.py                             # launch UI
```

1. Edit `data/validation_rules.yaml`, then click **Reload Rules** or run `python etl/seed_validation_rules.py`.
2. Click **Run Validation** – inbox refreshes; verify rule behaviour.

The AI assistant can:
• Draft or tweak YAML snippets on request.  
• Explain or locate specific validation findings.  
• Generate new test cases to extend mock-DB coverage.
