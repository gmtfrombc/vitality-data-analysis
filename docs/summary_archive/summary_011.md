# Daily Summary – Session 011

## Context
Following our roadmap (WS-2) and building on yesterday's date range filtering capabilities, today we focused on implementing multi-metric correlation analysis. This feature allows users to explore relationships between different health metrics, providing deeper insights into how various factors might influence each other in a metabolic health program.

## What was done today
1. **Enhanced Query Intent Model**
   • Added "correlation" as a new analysis type in the `QueryIntent` class
   • Updated system prompt to recognize correlation-related queries
   • Implemented parsing for correlation method parameters (Pearson, Spearman)

2. **Added Visualization Support**
   • Created a new `scatter_plot` function in `app/utils/plots.py`
   • Implemented regression line visualization
   • Added correlation coefficient display in plot titles
   • Ensured compatibility with the existing plotting framework

3. **Added Statistical Analysis Tools**
   • Implemented `correlation_coefficient` function in `app/utils/metrics.py`
   • Added support for different correlation methods (Pearson, Spearman)
   • Ensured proper handling of missing values and edge cases

4. **Enhanced AI Helper**
   • Updated `_build_code_from_intent` to handle correlation analysis
   • Added special handler for correlation queries
   • Implemented SQL generation for correlating metrics
   • Added built-in validation to prevent errors with insufficient data

5. **Auto-Visualization Integration**
   • Updated `auto_viz_mapper.py` to handle correlation results
   • Ensured scatter plots are properly displayed for correlation analysis

6. **Comprehensive Testing**
   • Created dedicated test file: `tests/test_correlation_analysis.py`
   • Added test cases for correlation coefficient calculation
   • Added tests for scatter plot generation
   • Added tests for cross-table joins and SQL generation
   • Added golden test case for weight-BMI correlation
   • Fixed sandbox security constraints to allow visualization in tests

## Next incremental steps
| Step | Description | PR Target |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Enhance correlation analysis with multiple metrics | **backend** |
   • Support for multi-variable correlation matrices
   • Heatmap visualization for correlation matrices
   • Statistical significance testing for correlations
| 2 | Advanced regression analysis capabilities | **backend** |
| 3 | Multi-user support for saved questions | **backend** |
| 4 | Dockerization and CI/CD setup | **devops** |

## Benefits and Impact
The multi-metric correlation analysis feature significantly enhances the clinical utility of the 'ask anything' assistant. Healthcare providers can now easily investigate relationships between different health metrics, such as:

- Correlation between weight and blood pressure
- Relationship between BMI changes and mental health scores
- Connection between patient engagement and health outcomes

These insights can help identify factors that influence patient outcomes, guide personalized interventions, and improve the overall effectiveness of the Metabolic Health Program.
