# Summary Testing Session 008 – 2025-05-11

## Focus
• Fixing incorrect A1C threshold use in BP-vs-A1C comparison
• Moving reference ranges out of LLM narrative into an **Assumptions / Reference ranges** block handled by UI
• Hardening sandbox after intermittent import failures (blocked `subprocess`, now `depends`)

## Key Changes
1. **Clinical reference handling**  
   – Added `get_range()` / `categorize_value()` helpers in `metric_reference.py`.  
   – UI now injects `results["reference"]` for downstream display; `_add_assumptions_section` renders nicely-formatted list.  
   – A1C "high" threshold now set to `pre_diabetes.min` (5.6 %) instead of 6.5 %.

2. **LLM Prompt Update**  
   – System prompt in `ai_helper.py` instructs the model to speak in categories ("normal A1C") and **not** recite numbers; reference ranges shown separately.

3. **Sandbox hardening**  
   – Universal stub module for `subprocess` always installed; exposes common attrs that raise `RuntimeError` when called.  
   – Tests revised to expect stub behaviour (import succeeds; execution blocked).  
   – All tests green (263 passed, 1 skipped).

4. **Documentation & Changelog**  
   – `CHANGELOG.md` updated.  
   – `ROADMAP_CANVAS.md` backlog item added for remaining sandbox import issues (`depends`, hvplot dynamic imports).

## Outstanding Issue – *Sandbox blocked-import warning*
`holoviews.operation.element.Dependencies` indirectly imports a module called **depends** which is **not** on the allow-list; this triggers warnings and sandbox fallback to rules-engine.

### Attempts so far
1.  Added universal stub for `subprocess` (fixed previous failure).  
2.  Extended `_IMPORT_WHITELIST` but kept tight for security.

The **depends** module appears to be an internal helper loaded via `hvplot`; simply allow-listing may be safe but needs verification.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Trace call stack to confirm `depends` origin; if it belongs to holoviews/hvplot, add stub similar to `subprocess` or extend allow-list safely.
2. Add unit test reproducing import of `depends` to lock behaviour.  
3. Run sandbox with example hvplot chart to validate import-flow end-to-end.
4. Document security review policy for any future whitelist expansions.
