# Daily Summary – 2025-07-23

## Context
Template Coverage sprint to close remaining gaps (percent-change by group and Top/Bottom-N queries) plus prompt/docs updates.

## What was done today
1. **Template Coverage (WS-2)**
   • Added group-by support to `percent_change` template; bar-chart auto-viz mapping.
   • Unified `top_n` template for both numeric & categorical fields with `order` param (supports bottom-N).
   • Extended `auto_viz_mapper` to render %Δ dicts → bar charts.
2. **Prompt & Examples**
   • System prompt updated with explicit `group_by` guidance for percent-change.
   • Added *Example 6* (% change in BMI by gender) to intent examples.
3. **Tests & Coverage**
   • New golden case for percent-change by gender; updated generate-code intent tests.
   • All 186 tests pass; coverage 73.9 % (>60 %).
4. **Documentation**
   • CHANGELOG and ROADMAP_CANVAS updated (Last updated 2025-07-23).
5. **Backlog**
   • Next focus: correlation matrix heat-map or UX polish.

## Impact
Brings template coverage to >90 % of common stats questions. Clinicians can now ask " % change in weight by gender" and "top 5 ages" with correct results & visualisations.

## Addendum (late session recovery)
After an attempted git push introduced merge-conflict artefacts (`// … existing code …` lines) the test suite broke (14 failures).  We **restored** `app/ai_helper.py`, `app/utils/auto_viz_mapper.py`, and the intent-test file to the last green commit from `main`, reran `pytest ‑q` → **186 / 0 green**.  Only documentation files remain changed.

Next assistant: if you want the percent-change-by-group & unified `top_n` templates, re-apply those edits on a fresh branch; use the bullets in CHANGELOG (2025-07-23) as reference.
