### 2025-05-22 Summary

Fixed a regression that broke four unit tests and caused the assistant to crash when setting a non-existent `raw_query` attribute on the parsed `QueryIntent`.  The fix adds a small `try/except` guard in two spots of `DataAnalysisAssistant`, restoring graceful handling when the intent object is a dict or a frozen Pydantic model.  All 17 tests now pass (`pytest -q`).  Changelog updated with the new entry.
