# Daily Summary – 2025-05-06

## What we did ✅
1.  **Enhanced Hybrid AI Engine (Priority 1)**
    *   Updated `ai_helper._build_code_from_intent` to generate SQL supporting multi-metric aggregates (e.g., `AVG(weight), AVG(bmi)`) and arbitrary boolean/range filters from `QueryIntent.conditions` and `Filter.range` (e.g., `WHERE bmi > 30 AND age < 50`).
    *   Expanded `tests/golden/qa.yaml` with 6 new test cases exercising these new multi-metric and boolean/range filtering capabilities.
    *   Refined `tests/golden/test_golden_queries.py` harness (`_make_fake_df`) to correctly mock data for the new test types.
2.  **Resolved Persistent Import Errors**
    *   Diagnosed recurring `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` and `NameError: name 'pytest'/'yaml' is not defined` during test collection.
    *   **Fix:** Moved the `sys.path` modification logic from individual test files into a central `tests/conftest.py`. This ensures the project root is added to the Python path *before* pytest attempts to import any test modules or evaluate decorators, robustly fixing the collection-time import issues.
    *   Cleaned up import order in `test_golden_queries.py` accordingly.
3.  **Maintained Stability**
    *   Full test suite (`pytest -q`) passes (40/40).
    *   Coverage remains high (~81%).
    *   Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and this summary.
4.  **Verified V2 Intent Parsing**
    *   Added new unit tests to `tests/intent/test_get_query_intent.py` covering multi-metric (`additional_fields`) and group-by (`group_by`) scenarios.
    *   Fixed V1 test expectations to align with default Pydantic serialization (include default empty lists).
    *   Confirmed intent parsing logic correctly handles the expected richer JSON structure from the updated LLM prompt.

## Next up ▶️
*   **Live LLM Testing:** Manually test queries like "average weight and BMI by gender" to verify the *actual* LLM output matches the V2 intent structure based on the updated prompt.
*   Address warnings (Pydantic, Tornado event loop).
*   Refactor plotting helpers into `app/utils/plots.py`.
*   Scale golden harness to ≥25 queries.
