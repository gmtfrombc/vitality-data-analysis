# Daily Summary â€“ 2025-07-10

## Context
Continuing the incremental migration of *saved questions* storage to SQLite (WS-3).

## What was done today
1. **Unit tests (WS-3-A â€“ complete)**  
   â€¢ Added `tests/utils/test_saved_questions_db.py` covering happy-path load/upsert/delete plus edge cases.  
   â€¢ Uses temporary on-disk SQLite files to avoid `:memory:` connection traps.
2. **Read-only Assistant injection (WS-3-B â€“ in progress)**  
   â€¢ `app/pages/data_assistant.py` now attempts to load questions via `app.utils.saved_questions_db.load_saved_questions()` before falling back to the legacy JSON file.  
   â€¢ No changes to save/delete actions yet â€“ writes still target JSON until WS-3-C.
3. **Roadmap & Changelog**  
   â€¢ Roadmap WS-3 updated: WS-3-A âœ”, WS-3-B ðŸ”„.  
   â€¢ Changelog prepended with today's items; timestamp refreshed.
4. **Green build**  
   â€¢ All 65 tests pass; coverage 81 % (gate 60 %).

## Next incremental steps
| Step | Description | PR Target |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| WS-3-C | Wire `Save / Delete Question` UI to call `upsert_question` / `delete_question` | **WS-3-C** |
| WS-3-D | Remove JSON fallback after burn-in, migrate existing `saved_questions.json` on first run | **WS-3-D** |

Other backlog items unchanged.
