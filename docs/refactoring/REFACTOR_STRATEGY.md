Great question—refactoring a growing Python codebase without breaking functionality is a classic challenge. You’re absolutely right to pause and organize before further expansion.

Below is a structured, safe and model-aware strategy you can follow within Cursor, tailored for your environment and goals:

⸻

🔧 PHASED REFACTORING METHODOLOGY

🧭 PHASE 0: Prep & Protection

Goal: Safeguard current working version before changes.
	1.	Commit & Tag

git commit -am "pre-refactor checkpoint"
git tag pre_refactor_stable


	2.	Run full test suite
	•	Use pytest -q --tb=short
	•	Confirm current tests pass and coverage is stable
	3.	Freeze working models
	•	Lock in your preferred “thinking model” (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet) for code generation & decisions
	•	Use manual or ask mode in Cursor—not agent mode—during structural changes

🗃️ PHASE 1: File Audit & Cleanup Plan

Goal: Identify stale, duplicate, or overly large files
	1.	Use a script or AI query to map:
	•	All Python files over 300 lines
	•	Files not imported or referenced
	•	.md, .txt, .csv, .json not accessed in last 30 days
Example command:

find . -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -n


	2.	Categorize each item:

File	Status	Action
data_assistant.py	Core (too large)	Split into modules
temp_script_1.py	Unused	Archive or delete
summary_2025.md	Doc ref	Move to /docs
plot_helper.py	Repetitive	Merge/refactor


	3.	Move archival files to a /legacy or /archive folder, versioned separately.

🧱 PHASE 2: Restructure Directory Layout

Goal: Logical organization, modular code, clear boundaries

Proposed layout:

app/
├── __init__.py
├── core/                  # Core logic split into manageable files
│   ├── query_engine.py
│   ├── result_builder.py
│   └── data_loader.py
├── utils/                 # Helpers (e.g., enums, formatters)
│   ├── patient_attributes.py
│   └── label_helpers.py
├── components/            # UI & dashboard logic
│   ├── charts.py
│   └── feedback.py
├── db/                    # Queries & DB access logic
│   ├── db_query.py
│   └── migrations/
├── tests/
│   ├── test_query_engine.py
│   └── test_utils.py
main.py                    # Entrypoint

✂️ PHASE 3: Refactor Monoliths (e.g., data_assistant.py)

Goal: Extract reusable units and reduce surface area
	1.	In ask mode, prompt Claude 3.7 “thinking” with:
Please analyze data_assistant.py and recommend which logical blocks should be moved to modules under core/. Propose function signatures and destination modules. Don’t move code yet.
	2.	Review & confirm.
	3.	Use manual mode or low-risk agent mode to:
	•	Extract functions into new files
	•	Replace blocks in data_assistant.py with imports
	4.	After each major refactor:
	•	✅ Run pytest -q
	•	✅ Use git diff and git commit -am "refactor: move X to core/query_engine.py"

⸻

🧪 PHASE 4: Tests & Validation

Goal: Ensure refactor doesn’t break anything
	1.	Run full test suite after each block
	2.	Fix import paths if needed
	3.	Add a smoke test: “App loads + can process a query”

⸻

🔄 PHASE 5: Continuous Maintenance

Goal: Ongoing hygiene
	•	Add new utility functions to utils/ or core/ only
	•	Document major helpers in /docs/developer_guide.md
	•	Regularly archive stale experiments or feature spikes

🤖 Model Strategy Cheat Sheet

Use Case	Recommended Model	Cursor Mode
Code file review	Claude 3.7 basic	Ask/manual
Refactor logic decisions	Claude 3.7 thinking	Ask/manual
Mass search/replace	Claude 3.7 basic	Ask/agent (cautious)
File organization plan	Claude 3.7 thinking	Ask/manual
Cleanup test reports	Claude 3.7 basic	Ask
Code generation or split	Claude 3.7 thinking → o3 if needed	Manual (avoid prompt bloat)

✅ Final Thoughts

You’re absolutely right to get ahead of tech debt now. This approach:
	•	Reduces future bugs,
	•	Helps the assistant better reason about structure,
	•	Improves long-term maintainability for new features like custom semantics (program_completer).
