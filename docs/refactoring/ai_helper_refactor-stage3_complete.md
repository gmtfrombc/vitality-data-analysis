# AI Helper Refactoring - Step 3 Complete

## Summary of Refactoring Progress

We have successfully completed Step 3 of the `ai_helper.py` refactoring plan. The monolithic AI helper is being broken down into smaller, focused modules to improve maintainability and testability.

### Completed Steps

- ✅ **Step 0: Pre-check**
  - Created branch `refactor-ai-helper`
  - Confirmed baseline tests passing

- ✅ **Step 1: Identify Functional Sections**
  - Tagged major logic groups in `ai_helper.py`
  - Identified clear boundaries between components

- ✅ **Step 2: Create Target Modules**
  - Created all target modules with appropriate docstrings:
    - `llm_interface.py` - GPT call, retry, token counting
    - `prompt_templates.py` - prompt scaffolds and builders
    - `intent_parser.py` - intent JSON validation
    - `code_generator.py` - code templates and rendering
    - `clarifier.py` - missing field detection, questions
    - `narrative_builder.py` - result interpretation

- ✅ **Step 3: Move Code in Stages**
  - Moved core functions to respective modules:
    - Moved GPT call & retry logic to `llm_interface.py`
    - Moved prompt builders to `prompt_templates.py`
    - Moved intent parsing to `intent_parser.py`
    - Moved clarification logic to `clarifier.py`
    - Moved result narrative functions to `narrative_builder.py`
    - Added placeholder template rendering to `code_generator.py`

### Current Status

- All tests remain green after Step 3 changes
- The original code in `ai_helper.py` remains intact
- New modules independently implement core functionality
- Some modules (like `code_generator.py`) still rely on the original AIHelper class temporarily

## Next Steps

### Step 4: Wire Back to `ai_helper.py`

- Replace the original implementations in `ai_helper.py` with imports from the new modules
- Update AIHelper class methods to delegate to the new modules
- Ensure all reused functions are properly exported via `__all__` in each module
- Maintain behavior compatibility throughout the process
- Make changes incrementally and run tests after each change

### Step 5: Run Tests

- Re-run existing unit and smoke tests after all wiring is complete
- Add one new test per moved module to verify functionality
- Manually verify end-to-end GPT query behavior

### Step 6: Final Cleanup

- Remove unused code from `ai_helper.py`
- Complete documentation in new modules
- Update project documentation

## Implementation Notes

1. We've taken a progressive approach, moving one functional area at a time and running tests after each change
2. For complex areas like code generation, we've created wrappers that temporarily delegate to the original implementation
3. Type hints have been added to improve code quality
4. Docstrings follow project conventions with clear parameter and return value documentation

## Handoff Instructions

The next assistant should:

1. Begin implementing Step 4, focusing on one function at a time
2. Start with the simplest functions (`generate_clarifying_questions` is a good candidate)
3. Modify `AIHelper` methods to use imports from new modules
4. Verify tests pass after each change
5. If any issues arise, revert to the original implementation and troubleshoot
