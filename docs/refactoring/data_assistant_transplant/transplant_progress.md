### Feature Transplant Progress Update (2025-05-30)

We've recovered `data_assistant_legacy.py` from the old monolithic implementation, which contains features that didn't make it into the modular refactor (e.g., program completer logic, narrative changes, chart stubs, etc.).

- These features were never migrated into the new modular layout in `app/data_assistant.py` and related utils.

- In this project we are transplanting the code from the legacy file into the modular refactor

### Completed Steps
1. ‚úÖ **Identified Legacy Features**: Analyzed the legacy `data_assistant_legacy.py` to identify features added after the initial modularization.
2. ‚úÖ **Transplanted Threshold Query Analysis**: Successfully implemented the threshold query functionality into the modular codebase:
   - Added `detect_threshold_query()` method to `engine.py` to identify queries with threshold conditions
   - Added `_enhance_threshold_visualization()` method to improve visualization of threshold results
   - Updated `generate_analysis_code()` to support custom prompts for threshold queries
   - Added `format_threshold_results()` to `analysis_helpers.py` for better display of threshold query results
   - Fixed several issues related to UI rendering of threshold results
3. ‚úÖ **Transplanted Active/Inactive Logic**: Successfully implemented the active/inactive patient filter functionality:
   - Added `detect_active_inactive_filter()` method to `engine.py` to identify queries referencing active/inactive patients
   - Updated `process_clarification()` to detect and store active/inactive preferences from user clarifications
   - Updated `generate_analysis_code()` to apply the active/inactive filter to the intent based on parameters
   - Enhanced `generate_clarifying_questions()` in `clarifier.py` to include questions about active/inactive status when appropriate
   - Updated `execute_analysis()` and `interpret_results()` to include active/inactive status in result processing
   - Enhanced `format_results()` and `format_threshold_results()` in `analysis_helpers.py` to display active/inactive status in results
4. ‚úÖ **Transplanted BMI Unit Handling**: Added robust weight unit conversion between kg and lbs throughout the analysis code generators.

### Current Status
- Threshold query analysis is now fully implemented in the modular codebase
- Active/Inactive patient filtering is now properly supported with automatic detection and clarification
- The application runs correctly, handling queries like "How many patients with BMI>30" and "How many active patients"
- The test suite passes with the new functionality
- The UI correctly displays threshold visualizations and results, including active/inactive status information

### Next Steps
5. üîÑ **Program Completion Status**: Logic to determine if a patient has completed or dropped out of the program.
6. ‚è±Ô∏è **Visit Patterns**: Analysis of visitation patterns over time.
7. ‚è±Ô∏è **Trends by Month**: Aggregation of metrics by calendar month.
8. ‚è±Ô∏è **Chart stub endpoints**: Backend utilities for faster chart generation.

### Testing
- Each feature is tested in isolation with specific test cases.
- The entire system is tested with integration tests to ensure all features work together.
- A test plan document is maintained for each feature.

### Documentation
- Code level documentation is updated as features are added.
- User-facing documentation is updated to reflect new capabilities.
- Project documentation is maintained in this repository.

### Issues Encountered and Resolved
- Scalar results needed to be wrapped in dictionaries when threshold info was present
- Panel's Tabulator widget no longer accepts "light" as a theme option (changed to "default")
- The sandbox needed to be updated to allow for traceback module usage
- The stage transition logic needed updating to allow skipping clarification when not needed
- Active/inactive status needed to be properly detected and propagated throughout the analysis pipeline

_The active/inactive patient filter transplant is now complete!_ The next assistant can continue with transplanting the remaining features, starting with the BMI Unit Handling.
