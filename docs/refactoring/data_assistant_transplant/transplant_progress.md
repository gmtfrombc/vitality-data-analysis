### Feature Transplant Progress Update (2025-05-30)

We've recovered `data_assistant_legacy.py` from the old monolithic implementation, which contains features that didn't make it into the modular refactor (e.g., program completer logic, narrative changes, chart stubs, etc.).

- These features were never migrated into the new modular layout in `app/data_assistant.py` and related utils.

- In this project we are transplanting the code from the legacy file into the modular refactor

### Completed Steps
1. ‚úÖ **Identified Legacy Features**: Analyzed the legacy `data_assistant_legacy.py` to identify features added after the initial modularization.
2. ‚úÖ **Transplanted Threshold Query Analysis**: Successfully implemented the threshold query functionality into the modular codebase:
   - Added `detect_threshold_query()` method to `engine.py` to identify queries with threshold conditions
   - Added `_enhance_threshold_visualization()` method to improve visualization of threshold results
   - Updated `generate_analysis_code()` to support custom prompts for threshold queries
   - Added `format_threshold_results()` to `analysis_helpers.py` for better display of threshold query results
   - Fixed several issues related to UI rendering of threshold results
3. ‚úÖ **Transplanted Active/Inactive Logic**: Successfully implemented the active/inactive patient filter functionality:
   - Added `detect_active_inactive_filter()` method to `engine.py` to identify queries referencing active/inactive patients
   - Updated `process_clarification()` to detect and store active/inactive preferences from user clarifications
   - Updated `generate_analysis_code()` to apply the active/inactive filter to the intent based on parameters
   - Enhanced `generate_clarifying_questions()` in `clarifier.py` to include questions about active/inactive status when appropriate
   - Updated `execute_analysis()` and `interpret_results()` to include active/inactive status in result processing
   - Enhanced `format_results()` and `format_threshold_results()` in `analysis_helpers.py` to display active/inactive status in results
4. ‚úÖ **Transplanted BMI Unit Handling**: Added robust weight unit conversion between kg and lbs throughout the analysis code generators.
5. ‚úÖ **Centralized Reference Ranges**: All normal/abnormal clinical threshold logic is now routed through the unified reference range module:
   - Created `app/reference_ranges.py` (or `app/ranges.py`), defining all clinical reference ranges in one place
   - Implemented `flag_abnormal()` helper for uniform detection of values outside reference limits
   - Replaced hard-coded legacy thresholds throughout the codebase with the central helper
   - Confirmed via `grep` that no stray thresholds or "magic numbers" remain in the app logic
   - Updated and added tests for all at-range, below-range, and above-range cases (all green)
   - Documented the new helper API and module location

### Current Status
- Threshold query analysis is now fully implemented in the modular codebase
- Active/Inactive patient filtering is now properly supported with automatic detection and clarification
- BMI unit logic is robust and conversion-safe
- **Reference range and abnormal value logic is fully centralized and test-covered**
- The application runs correctly, handling queries like "How many patients with BMI>30" and "How many active patients"
- The test suite passes with the new functionality
- The UI correctly displays threshold visualizations and results, including active/inactive status information

### Next Steps (Handoff)
6. üîÑ **Query Refinement**: Begin transplanting any logic related to making user queries more robust, interpretable, or user-friendly. This includes:
   - Improving parsing and clarification of ambiguous or partial queries
   - Enhancing support for synonyms, misspellings, and user intent detection
   - Making query handling more resilient to edge cases or free-text input

7. ‚è±Ô∏è **(Visit Patterns, Trends by Month, Chart Stub Endpoints...)**  
   Proceed with subsequent features as outlined in the transplant guide.

### Testing
- Each feature is tested in isolation with specific test cases.
- The entire system is tested with integration tests to ensure all features work together.
- A test plan document is maintained for each feature.

### Documentation
- Code level documentation is updated as features are added.
- User-facing documentation is updated to reflect new capabilities.
- Project documentation is maintained in this repository.

### Issues Encountered and Resolved
- Scalar results needed to be wrapped in dictionaries when threshold info was present
- Panel's Tabulator widget no longer accepts "light" as a theme option (changed to "default")
- The sandbox needed to be updated to allow for traceback module usage
- The stage transition logic needed updating to allow skipping clarification when not needed
- Active/inactive status needed to be properly detected and propagated throughout the analysis pipeline
- Reference range logic previously scattered is now unified, no stray thresholds remain

_Reference range migration and all prior sprints are now fully complete. The codebase is stable, all tests pass, and the next step is Query Refinement._
