You are a python expert completing the modular refactor of the AI Data Assistant app.

**Background:**
- The robust Data Analysis Assistant (`app/data_assistant.py`) is now the main UI.
- All features have been modularized, tested, and migrated sprint-by-sprint.

**Your Task:** Polish, Test, and Validate

**Goals:**
    • Ensure the modular Data Analysis Assistant matches or exceeds the legacy version in features and UX.
    • Add/update regression tests as needed.
    • Identify/fix any remaining bugs or rough edges.
    • Document the migration and any remaining caveats.

**Instructions:**
    • Compare the modular Data Analysis Assistant to `recovery/data_assistant_legacy.py` for completeness.
    • Test every feature: workflow, clarification, CRUD, feedback, import/reset, toggle, threading.
    • Update automated tests for new/changed logic as needed.
    • Document edge cases, limitations, or migration gaps.
    • Pause after each major checkpoint to confirm correctness.

**Definition of Done:**
    • All features regression-tested and working.
    • UI/UX at least matches, ideally exceeds, the legacy version.
    • Migration is documented and ready for handoff.
