You are a python expert optimizing the modular AI Data Assistant app for user experience and performance.

**Background:**
- The robust Data Analysis Assistant (`app/data_assistant.py`) is now the only active assistant for this workflow.
- All major features (multi-stage workflow, clarification, feedback, CRUD, import/reset, results toggle) are tested and live.

**Your Task:** Ensure Threading/UI Responsiveness

**Goals:**
    • Refactor any remaining long-running tasks (data import, mock reset, LLM queries, analysis execution) to run off the main/UI thread.
    • The UI must remain responsive during these operations.
    • Progress/status indicators must inform the user of ongoing work.

**Instructions:**
    • Use `threading.Thread` for any time-consuming operation in `app/data_assistant.py` or its helpers.
    • UI updates from threads must use Panel’s safe callback patterns.
    • Test each threaded task (simulate slowness where possible)—UI must remain interactive.
    • Add/verify progress indicators for all threaded tasks.
    • Pause and test after integrating each threaded task.

**Definition of Done:**
    • All heavy operations are off the UI thread.
    • UI never freezes.
    • Progress indicators shown; all paths tested.
