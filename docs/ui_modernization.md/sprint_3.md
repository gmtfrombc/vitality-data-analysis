# SPRINT 3: Feedback Functionality

**Prompt:**

```
You are a python expert continuing the modularization of the AI Data Assistant app.

**Background:**
- The app is now modular, with a workflow engine, clarification stage, and saved query logic in place.
- You have access to the legacy implementation (`recovery/data_assistant_legacy.py`), which includes the original feedback UI/logic.
- Use the legacy file only to inform the *user experience and data flow*‚Äîrebuild/modernize as needed for the modular design.

**What has been done so far:**
    ‚Ä¢ Modular workflow with stage transitions and indicators are in place
    ‚Ä¢ Clarification workflow is implemented and tested
    ‚Ä¢ Saved query CRUD and basic result rendering are working

---

**Your Task:** Add Feedback Functionality

**Goals:**
    ‚Ä¢ Implement thumbs up/down feedback controls after results are displayed.
    ‚Ä¢ Store feedback in SQLite using `insert_feedback` from `app/utils/feedback_db.py`.
    ‚Ä¢ Acknowledge feedback submission in the UI with a ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù or similar message.

**Instructions:**
    ‚Ä¢ Refer to the legacy file for feedback UX patterns, but rebuild for modular architecture.
    ‚Ä¢ Add feedback buttons (üëçüëé) to the result panel‚Äîmake them accessible and intuitive.
    ‚Ä¢ Wire feedback submission to `insert_feedback`, including relevant context (query, result, timestamp, etc).
    ‚Ä¢ Show a brief thank you or confirmation message after feedback is received.
    ‚Ä¢ Add print/logging for every feedback action (button click, DB write, UI update).
    ‚Ä¢ **Pause frequently**: Test both thumbs up and down, and confirm the feedback is persisted in the database.
    ‚Ä¢ Ensure modular code organization and event-driven logic throughout.
    ‚Ä¢ Do **not** copy-paste from legacy‚Äîtranslate to clean, modern modular code.

**Definition of Done:**
    ‚Ä¢ Feedback can be submitted and is persisted to SQLite.
    ‚Ä¢ UI shows a thank you/confirmation message after feedback.
    ‚Ä¢ Both up and down flows tested and confirmed in UI and database.
    ‚Ä¢ Pytests and ruff checks pass, and app launches with visible feedback UI.
