# Development Summary - July 24, 2025

## Primary Accomplishments
✅ Completed the correlation matrix heat-map template (WS-4 milestone)  
✅ Fixed runtime visualization issues with HoloViews/Panel type validation  
✅ All unit tests passing with proper coverage

## Technical Details

### Correlation Matrix Implementation
- Created new `compute_correlation()` helper in `app/utils/analysis_helpers.py` that:
  - Calculates correlation coefficients between multiple numeric metrics
  - Generates p-values for statistical significance testing
  - Returns symmetric matrices ready for visualization
- Enhanced `correlation_heatmap()` in `plots.py` to:
  - Display correlation coefficients in cells
  - Mark statistically significant correlations
  - Use a blue-red colormap to show negative/positive correlations

### Visualization Improvements
- Refactored `histogram()` to return proper HoloViews objects at runtime
- Implemented smart fallback path when `hvplot` is unavailable (builds `hv.Histogram` manually)
- Fixed `Element`/`ViewableElement` type validation issues in Panel validation (preventing "HoloMap does not accept Element type" errors)
- Maintained backward-compatibility with existing tests

### Test Coverage
- Added unit test for correlation matrix helper
- Verified runtime behavior with manual testing
- Maintained high code coverage across the codebase

## Next Steps
1. Priority 2: Intent Engine Hardening & Fallback Coverage
   - Implement slot-based Smart Clarifier
   - Add generic fallback template for low-confidence queries
2. Complete the necessary UI indicators for these features

## Additional Artifacts
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with completed work
- Updated ROADMAP_CANVAS.md to mark Correlation matrix milestone as complete
