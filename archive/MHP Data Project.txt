Metabolic Health Data Analysis & AI-Assisted SQL Query Web Application

1. Overview

The goal of this project is to build an interactive, data-driven web application for in-depth analysis of metabolic health patient data. The app will ingest patient data from JSON files, update a local SQLite database incrementally, and provide a user-friendly interface to view, query, and edit patient records. An integrated ChatGPT assistant will help generate custom SQL queries from natural language prompts. The app will be built primarily using Python and Panel, with a future roadmap that includes server/cloud deployment options.

2. Key Components

2.1 Data Ingestion & Database Update
	•	Data Source:
	•	Patient data in JSON format containing:
	•	Vital signs
	•	Mental health survey results
	•	Lab metrics
	•	Patient visit completions
	•	Medication usage
	•	Audio transcript notes
	•	Future data: Wearable integrations and other additional metrics.
	•	Database:
	•	SQLite for local storage.
	•	Schema Design:
	•	Tables for each data type (patients, vital signs, surveys, labs, visits, medications, transcripts).
	•	Unique identifiers to manage incremental updates (e.g., patient ID).
	•	Update Script:
	•	A Python script that:
	•	Parses the JSON file.
	•	Checks for new patient records.
	•	Adds only new records to the SQLite database (ensuring that manually edited or updated records are not overwritten).
	•	Can be executed on a weekly basis (via a scheduled task/cron job).

2.2 Backend & Query Layer
	•	Database Interaction:
	•	Use Python’s sqlite3 module or an ORM like SQLAlchemy for database operations.
	•	Pandas for data manipulation, report generation, and complex querying.
	•	APIs & Data Extraction:
	•	Functions to retrieve patient data and run granular SQL queries.
	•	Utilities to handle data transformation and aggregation.

2.3 Interactive Web Application (Using Panel)
	•	Framework:
	•	Panel for building the interactive web dashboard and control interfaces.
	•	User Interface Components:
	•	Data Analysis Dashboard:
	•	Interactive charts, filters, and controls for in-depth data analysis.
	•	Integration with Pandas to visualize query results.
	•	Patient Dashboard:
	•	Detailed view of individual patient data.
	•	Editable fields for correcting or completing missing data.
	•	Functionality to update the SQLite database based on user input.
	•	AI Assistant Interface:
	•	Input field for natural language queries.
	•	Display area for the generated SQL query.
	•	Option to review and execute the generated query on the database.

2.4 AI Integration with ChatGPT
	•	ChatGPT API:
	•	Use the OpenAI Python SDK to connect to the ChatGPT API.
	•	The AI assistant will:
	•	Accept natural language input from the user.
	•	Generate SQL queries based on the prompt.
	•	Provide an interface for the user to review the generated SQL before execution.

2.5 Development Environment & Future Roadmap
	•	Development Tools:
	•	VS Code as the primary code editor.
	•	Jupyter Notebooks for prototyping data manipulations, database queries, and testing API interactions.
	•	Deployment:
	•	Initially deployed and run locally.
	•	Future plans include cloud deployment or serverless functions (e.g., Firebase functions) for scalability.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Security & Privacy:
	•	Ensure patient data remains secure.
	•	Use local SQLite storage with proper access controls.
	•	Maintainability & Extensibility:

	•	Easily extendable to include additional data sources (e.g., wearables).
	•	Usability:
	•	A visually appealing and intuitive UI.
	•	Seamless interaction between the UI, database, and AI components.
	•	Performance:
	•	Efficient incremental updates and query processing.
	•	Responsive web interface for data visualization and editing.
