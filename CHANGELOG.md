[Unreleased] – ongoing
✨ Feature: Slot-based Smart Clarifier for intent engine hardening (#WS-2, #WS-4) - Identifies specific missing information in queries 
🧩 Added MissingSlot and SlotType for focused, structured clarification requests in `app/utils/intent_clarification.py`
🛠️ Implemented generic fallback template for low-confidence queries with data schema inspection and relevant visualizations
🧪 Added tests for slot-based clarifier functionality in `tests/utils/test_intent_clarification.py`
✨ Feature: Correlation matrix heat-map template (#WS-4) – Supports 2+ metrics with visualized p-values
🧩 Added `compute_correlation()` helper with p-value calculation in new `app/utils/analysis_helpers.py`
🛠️ Improved plots.py histogram to return proper HoloViews objects for Panel compatibility
📊 Fixed panel/HoloViews type validation in runtime path via fallback to native hv.Histogram objects
🧪 Added unit test for correlation helper in tests/utils/test_correlation_heatmap.py
✅ Percent-change by-group template (#WS-2) – supports `group_by` and bar-chart auto-viz
✅ Template: Top/Bottom-N counts (numeric & categorical) with `order` param; prompt & tests updated
✅ Docs & prompt: Added Example 6 for percent-change by gender; system prompt clarifies group_by rule
✅ Tests: Added new golden & intent cases; all 186 tests green, coverage 73.9 %
✅ Verified run.py functionality and test coverage - Application starts correctly and test coverage remains at 75%
✅ Tests: Expanded golden-query harness to >30 test cases including std_dev, multi-metric by gender, date range filtering
✨ Feature: Dynamic code generation sandbox (#WS-2) – Enhanced templates for trend, distribution, and comparison analyses
🚧 Added specialized code generation for distribution & comparison use cases with appropriate visualizations
🔧 Fixed trend analysis to work reliably with month-level time series data
🐛 Identified: Mock holoviews objects in plots.py causing 19/22 test failures
🚧 Improvement plan: Implement simplified mocks or custom __instancecheck__ to fix test failures without breaking inspection
⚙️ Current coverage remains healthy at 73.38% despite test failures
✨ Feature: Multi-metric correlation analysis (#WS-2) – Support for correlation queries between two metrics (e.g., "Is there a correlation between weight and BMI?")
🧩 Added scatter_plot function with regression line visualization and correlation coefficient display
⚡️ Implemented correlation_coefficient function with support for Pearson and Spearman methods
🛠️ Updated QueryIntent model, AI Helper, and sandbox security to support correlation analysis
🧪 Added tests: Unit tests for correlation functionality and golden test for weight-BMI correlation
✨ Feature: Date range filtering capability (#WS-2) – Support for queries with specific date ranges like "from January to March 2025"
🧩 Enhanced QueryIntent model with DateRange class for standardized date handling
⚡️ SQL generation now supports global time_range and Filter.date_range objects in all templates
🧪 Added tests: Unit tests for DateRange model and integration tests for date range queries
📊 Added golden test for weight trends time series with date range filtering
✨ Added unit tests for V2 intent parsing (`additional_fields`, `group_by`) in `tests/intent/test_get_query_intent.py`.
✨ Expanded intent parser & SQL templates: now handles multi-metric aggregates (e.g., avg weight & BMI) and boolean/range conditions (e.g., BMI > 30, age < 50).
✨ Expanded golden harness: added 6 new cases covering multi-metric and boolean filter scenarios.
🛠️ Fixed persistent test import errors: moved sys.path patch to `tests/conftest.py` for reliable module discovery before collection.
🐛 Scalar result support – DataAnalysisAssistant now accepts NumPy scalars; float64 crash fixed.
✨ Happy-path integration smoke test for average weight scenario added; coverage climbs +2 %. Roadmap milestones updated.
✨ Architecture docs – Added docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with module map & data flow.
📜 Cursor rules – Introduced .cursorrules for naming, tests, LLM usage.
🗺️ Roadmap canvas – Added ROADMAP_CANVAS.md and updated README.md link.
🤖 Hybrid AI integration – app/ai_helper.py and GPT-4 hooks in Data Assistant.
💾 Persistent saved questions – JSON file storage with load/save helpers.
🖼️ Pie chart fixes – Switched to hvplot(kind='pie').
🔧 UI tweaks – Save / reset buttons & delete-question flow.
🧩 Clarifying intent workflow – Assistant now detects vague queries, asks follow-up questions with a text input, and only proceeds when clarified; added heuristic, UI elements, and updated tests; fixed pandas truth-value errors.
🐛 Safe raw_query assignment – Wrapped intent.raw_query set in DataAnalysisAssistant with try/except to prevent AttributeError and restore passing tests.
⏱️ Sandbox timeout (3 s) + import whitelist hardened; security test added.
📈 Deterministic templates expanded – median, distribution histogram, and monthly trend (AVG per YYYY-MM) with unit tests.
✅ Coverage gate 60 % enforced via .coveragerc omit list; current 72 %.
📚 Docs updated (README, ARCHITECTURE) for new templates & security lane.
✨ Roadmap Sprint plan committed – new milestones (golden query harness, richer templates, auto-viz) and backlog revamped (05-04).
✅ Golden-query harness completed – all 5 canonical cases pass; moved milestone to *done*.
🐛 Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError: app` by re-ordering sys.path injection before project imports in golden harness.
⬆️ Coverage surpasses 80 % (was 75 %); 34 tests green.
✨ WS-3-A: Added `tests/utils/test_saved_questions_db.py` covering load/upsert/delete and edge cases (duplicate names, bad path).
🔄 WS-3-B: `DataAnalysisAssistant` now loads saved questions from SQLite first, falling back to JSON; helpers remain read-only until WS-3-C.
✔ WS-3-C: Save & Delete actions now write to SQLite (`upsert_question` / `delete_question`) with graceful JSON fallback.
⬆️ Coverage holds at 81 % (gate 60 %) with 65 tests green.
✨ WS-3-D: Added DB migration engine (`app/utils/db_migrations.py`) and baseline `migrations/001_initial.sql`, `
✅ UX: Tooltip hints added to saved-question buttons (#WS-4)
✅ Tests: Added 10 tricky-intent cases + matching golden & smoke tests; harness now 45 cases total
✨ Feature: Confidence-scoring heuristic & ambiguous-phrase detection in `query_intent.py`
✨ Feature: Expanded synonym mapping (blood sugar, HbA1c, blood-pressure aliases) & field normalisation helper
🔧 Sandbox hardened – whitelisted `hvplot` and `unicodedata`; wrapped optional `hvplot.pandas` import to avoid blocked-dependency crashes
🐛 Golden-harness normalised visualization key handling to prevent spurious diff when mocked plots present
✅ All 185 tests green; coverage 74.6 %
✅ Feature: Query/response logging MVP – migration 006, helper `query_logging.py`, DataAnalysisAssistant integration, unit test.
