[Unreleased] – ongoing
✨ Added unit tests for V2 intent parsing (`additional_fields`, `group_by`) in `tests/intent/test_get_query_intent.py`.
✨ Expanded intent parser & SQL templates: now handles multi-metric aggregates (e.g., avg weight & BMI) and boolean/range conditions (e.g., BMI > 30, age < 50).
✨ Expanded golden harness: added 6 new cases covering multi-metric and boolean filter scenarios.
🛠️ Fixed persistent test import errors: moved sys.path patch to `tests/conftest.py` for reliable module discovery before collection.
🐛 Scalar result support – DataAnalysisAssistant now accepts NumPy scalars; float64 crash fixed.
✨ Happy-path integration smoke test for average weight scenario added; coverage climbs +2 %. Roadmap milestones updated.
✨ Architecture docs – Added docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with module map & data flow.
📜 Cursor rules – Introduced .cursorrules for naming, tests, LLM usage.
🗺️ Roadmap canvas – Added ROADMAP_CANVAS.md and updated README.md link.
🤖 Hybrid AI integration – app/ai_helper.py and GPT-4 hooks in Data Assistant.
💾 Persistent saved questions – JSON file storage with load/save helpers.
🖼️ Pie chart fixes – Switched to hvplot(kind='pie').
🔧 UI tweaks – Save / reset buttons & delete-question flow.
🧩 Clarifying intent workflow – Assistant now detects vague queries, asks follow-up questions with a text input, and only proceeds when clarified; added heuristic, UI elements, and updated tests; fixed pandas truth-value errors.
🐛 Safe raw_query assignment – Wrapped intent.raw_query set in DataAnalysisAssistant with try/except to prevent AttributeError and restore passing tests.
⏱️ Sandbox timeout (3 s) + import whitelist hardened; security test added.
📈 Deterministic templates expanded – median, distribution histogram, and monthly trend (AVG per YYYY-MM) with unit tests.
✅ Coverage gate 60 % enforced via .coveragerc omit list; current 72 %.
📚 Docs updated (README, ARCHITECTURE) for new templates & security lane.
✨ Roadmap Sprint plan committed – new milestones (golden query harness, richer templates, auto-viz) and backlog revamped (05-04).
✅ Golden-query harness completed – all 5 canonical cases pass; moved milestone to *done*.
🐛 Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError: app` by re-ordering sys.path injection before project imports in golden harness.
⬆️ Coverage surpasses 80 % (was 75 %); 34 tests green.
✨ WS-3-A: Added `tests/utils/test_saved_questions_db.py` covering load/upsert/delete and edge cases (duplicate names, bad path).
🔄 WS-3-B: `DataAnalysisAssistant` now loads saved questions from SQLite first, falling back to JSON; helpers remain read-only until WS-3-C.
✔ WS-3-C: Save & Delete actions now write to SQLite (`upsert_question` / `delete_question`) with graceful JSON fallback.
⬆️ Coverage holds at 81 % (gate 60 %) with 65 tests green.
✨ WS-3-D: Added DB migration engine (`app/utils/db_migrations.py`) and baseline `migrations/001_initial.sql`, `002_add_etl_columns.sql`, `003_unique_indexes.sql`.
✨ WS-3-D: Implemented `etl/json_ingest.py` CLI with idempotent upserts; 2× run verified, counts stable.
🧪 Tests: `tests/etl/test_db_migrations.py` and `tests/etl/test_json_ingest.py`; coverage now 75 %.
🖼️ Data Assistant sidebar now includes *Import Patient JSON* panel (FileInput + ETL trigger).
✨ Sidebar: re-added Narrative checkbox, removed duplicate save panel.
✨ Background ETL: spinner + thread + max-size guard; toast/Status fallback.
✨ Audit logging: migration 004 creates ingest_audit; ETL writes one row per import.
✨ Remove-mock-patients helper button (sidebar Cleanup card) with multitable delete.
📝 README updated with Import instructions & audit query sample.
🧪 Extended ingest tests for additive rows; all 68 tests pass.
🩹 Patient-view robust date parsing; fixed pd.to_datetime crashes.
✅ Coverage still 75 %.
🆕 Roadmap: Added *WS-6 Continuous Feedback & Evaluation* work stream with feedback widget, query logging, triage loop, and dataset prep.
🚀 Feature: Auto-viz mapper (#WS-4-A) – Intelligent visualization selection for query results
🛠️ Feature: User feedback collection system (#WS-6-A) – Thumbs up/down with comments
🔄 Fixed workflow stages to ensure tests pass with proper query execution flow

## [2025-07-09] – Refactor prep & SQLite groundwork
### Added
- `app/utils/saved_questions_db.py` – thin SQLite helper (create table, load, save, upsert, delete) ready for future UI integration.
- Roadmap milestone: *Automated JSON → SQLite update pipeline* under WS-3.

### Changed
- No production code changes; **rolled back** the attempted integration of SQLite into `app/pages/data_assistant.py` to keep the app stable.

### Fixed
- Restored green test suite (61 tests, 65 % coverage) after rollback.

### Notes
- Next incremental plan for the SQLite migration is captured in docs/summary_2025-07-09.md.
