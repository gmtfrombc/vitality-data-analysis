## 2025-05-11
### Fixed
- **Sandbox execution**: Added in-sandbox lightweight stubs for `holoviews`, `hvplot`, and `holoviews.Store` so imports inside generated snippets no longer raise `ImportError`. Sandbox now runs successfully for plotting-related queries instead of immediately falling back to the rule-engine.

### Known Issues
- AI-generated SQL for BP vs A1C query references non-existent column `vitals.score_type`, causing SQLite errors. See docs/summary_testing_011.md for details and next steps.
