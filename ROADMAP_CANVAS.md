# Roadmap Canvas

A high-level, living plan for the *VP Data Analysis* application.  
The canvas is intentionally brief and highly structured so an AI coding assistant (or any developer) can quickly parse, update, and act on the roadmap.

---
## 1. Vision
Provide healthcare teams with an interactive, AI-assisted data exploration tool that surfaces patient insights, automates common analytics, and scales from local use to cloud deployment.

---
## 2. Guiding Principles
1. **Hybrid AI + Rules** – Combine LLM flexibility with deterministic safeguards.
2. **Incremental Delivery** – Ship small, working increments; gather feedback early.
3. **Transparency & Reproducibility** – All generated code is visible, executable, and version-controlled.
4. **Security & Privacy** – Patient data never leaves the secure environment; PII is protected.

## 5. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| LLM hallucinations | Incorrect clinical insights | Medium | Keep deterministic post-processing; display code used |
| Data privacy breach | Legal & reputational | Low | Run models locally / mask PII; audit logging |
| Scope creep | Delays | Medium | Roadmap gatekeeper & time-boxed spikes |
| Test instability | Development friction | Low | ✅ Implemented robust mock strategy for visualization components with lightweight stubs |
| Condition mapping failures | Incorrect patient counts | Medium | ✅ Fixed code generation for condition-based queries including mental health conditions like anxiety |

## 6. Meta
- **Document owner:** @gmtfr  
- **Last updated:** 2025-05-24
- **Edit instructions for AI assistants:**  
  • Maintain markdown table formatting.  
  • Use ✔/☐/🔄 symbols for status.  
  • Preserve section headers.  
  • Keep backlog ≤ 10 items; archive completed ones.

### 2025-05-24 – Data Assistant Architecture Refactoring
- Refactored monolithic data_assistant.py into five specialized modules with clear separation of concerns
- Created app/ui.py for UI components, app/engine.py for query processing, app/analysis_helpers.py for formatting/visualization, and app/state.py for workflow management
- Added comprehensive docstrings to all modules explaining their purpose and interactions
- Created smoke tests to verify components work correctly together
- Updated README_data_assistant.md with architecture documentation
- All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring the refactoring maintained functionality

### 2025-05-23 – Weight change unit conversion improvement
- Enhanced weight change analysis to convert results from kilograms to pounds (lbs)
- Added explicit unit specification in results dictionary for better clarity
- Created test script (test_weight_change_with_units.py) to verify conversion logic
- All tests pass with the weight change now properly displayed in pounds
- This change improves UI consistency as the rest of the application uses imperial units

### 2025-05-22 – Sandbox 'copy' import issue fixed
- Fixed weight-change analysis sandbox execution by replacing `copy.deepcopy` with Pydantic's `model_copy(deep=True)` method
- Identified issue in `_generate_relative_change_analysis_code` function that used a blocked standard library import
- Created integration tests in `tests/sandbox/test_weight_change_sandbox.py` to specifically verify weight-change queries execute correctly in the sandbox
- The tests confirm no `copy` import statements exist in the generated code and that execution completes successfully
- This allows weight-change analysis to run directly in the sandbox without falling back to the rule engine

### 2025-05-20 – DateRange attribute access fix
- Fixed issue in data_assistant.py where code was incorrectly accessing DateRange attributes
- Updated _add_assumptions_section method to use start_date and end_date instead of start and end
- Ensured query_intent.py consistently enforces and validates DateRange attribute names
- All testing now passes with proper time range display in assumptions section
- Next steps: Additional validation of date range handling across the application

### 2025-05-19 – Improved condition query handling
- Enhanced condition detection in user queries with post-processing in `get_query_intent`
- Added cleanup of redundant filters whose values match detected conditions in `_generate_condition_count_code`
- Fixed the "no such column: score_type" error for queries with embedded condition terms
- Tests pass for all condition types including mental health, obesity, and others
- Next steps: Support for co-condition queries with logical operators (AND/OR)

### 2025-05-18 – Mental health condition mapping fix
- Fixed code generation for mental health conditions like anxiety
- Implemented proper detection of condition mentions in filter values even when not explicitly tagged as conditions
- Fixed YAML indentation issues in condition_mappings.yaml
- System now correctly uses ICD-10 codes for all condition-based queries
- Next steps: Implement support for co-condition queries (e.g., "How many patients have obesity AND hypertension?")

### 2025-05-15 – Condition mapping issue & AI Helper SQL Fixes
- Identified critical issue with obesity condition mapping not flowing from intent to code generation
- System tries to use BMI field directly instead of ICD-10 codes from the condition mapper
- See docs/summary_testing_015.md for detailed analysis and recommendations
- Fixed AI Helper SQL generation for BMI queries (using `vitals` table and joins) and ensured `COUNT(DISTINCT patients.id)` for accurate patient counts.

### 2025-05-11 – Sandbox stability patch
- Delivered holistic stubs for holoviews/hvplot inside sandbox (incl. Store registry) – 'Plotting libraries are disabled' ImportErrors resolved.
- Remaining blocker: AI-generated SQL for BP vs A1C uses `vitals.score_type` which doesn't exist. Recommend adding schema-aware validation or adjusting prompt templates/rule-engine fallback.  See docs/summary_testing_011.md.
