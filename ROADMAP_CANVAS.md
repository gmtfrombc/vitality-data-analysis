# Roadmap Canvas

A high-level, living plan for the *VP Data Analysis* application.  
The canvas is intentionally brief and highly structured so an AI coding assistant (or any developer) can quickly parse, update, and act on the roadmap.

---
## 1. Vision
Provide healthcare teams with an interactive, AI-assisted data exploration tool that surfaces patient insights, automates common analytics, and scales from local use to cloud deployment.

---
## 2. Guiding Principles
1. **Hybrid AI + Rules** – Combine LLM flexibility with deterministic safeguards.
2. **Incremental Delivery** – Ship small, working increments; gather feedback early.
3. **Transparency & Reproducibility** – All generated code is visible, executable, and version-controlled.
4. **Security & Privacy** – Patient data never leaves the secure environment; PII is protected.

## 3. Work Streams & Milestones
| ID | Work Stream | Goal | Milestones | Target Quarter |
|----|-------------|------|------------|----------------|
| WS-1 | **Stability & Refactor** | Solid baseline with tests and CI | ✔ Persist saved questions (file) <br> ✔ Unit test coverage ≥ 60 % <br> ✔ Golden query harness <br> ☐ Refactor duplicated code | Q2 2024 |
| WS-2 | **Hybrid AI Engine** | Natural-language analytics powered by GPT | ✔ OpenAI integration <br> ✔ Intent classification API <br> ✔ Richer code templates (var/std, pct-change, top-N, GROUP BY, Multi-Metric) <br> ✔ Date range filtering <br> ✔ Multi-metric correlation analysis <br> ✔ Enhanced correlation analysis (conditional, time-series) <br> ✔ Intent engine hardening (confidence scoring, synonym map, tricky-query harness) <br> ✔ Slot-based Smart Clarifier with fallback template <br> ✔ Template coverage (auto-viz hooks, top-N chart) | Q2–Q3 2024 |
| WS-3 | **Data & Storage** | Scalable, durable persistence | ✔ Move saved questions to SQLite (tests + read/write) <br> ✔ Add migrations <br> ✔ Incremental ETL & Import panel with audit logging <br> ☐ Multiple-user support | Q3 2024 |
| WS-4 | **UX & Visualization** | Intuitive interface & dashboards | ✔ Smart clarifier upgrade (slot-based follow-ups) <br> ✔ Correlation heat-map template <br> ✔ Enhanced correlation visualizations (conditional heatmaps, time-series plots) <br> ✔ Auto-visualisation mapper <br> ☐ Help & onboarding tour | Q3 2024 |
| WS-5 | **Cloud Deployment** | CI/CD & managed hosting | ☐ Dockerize app <br> ☐ GitHub Actions pipeline <br> ☐ Deploy to AWS/GCP <br> ☐ Observability (logging, metrics) | Q4 2024 |
| WS-6 | **Continuous Feedback & Evaluation** | Human-in-the-loop iterative improvement | ✔ Add feedback widget & `assistant_feedback` table <br> ✔ Query/response logging MVP <br> ✔ Nightly triage report <br> ☐ Weekly **Feedback Friday** loop <br> ☐ Dataset for fine-tuning | Q3 2025 |

## 4. Backlog (Next-Up Tasks)
- [x] **AI:** Intent engine hardening for ask-anything reliability (#ai)
- [ ] **AI:** Expand code-generation template coverage to 100 % common stats (#ai)
- [ ] **AI:** Confidence-based follow-up & generic fallback template (#ai)
- [ ] **UI:** Responsive layout overhaul – defer until multi-user support or v1 launch (#ux)
- [ ] **UI:** Drag-and-drop chart builder – defer until multi-user support or v1 launch (#ux)
- [x] **Feedback:** Query/response logging MVP (#feedback)
- [ ] **Perf:** In-memory schema introspection cache (#perf)
- [ ] **Dev:** IPython `%assistant` magic for rapid notebook testing (#dev)
- [ ] **Refactor:** Extract plotting utilities into `plots.py` (#code-health)
- [ ] **Deployment:** Draft minimal Dockerfile & GH Action (#devops)
- [x] **QA:** Synthetic "golden‑dataset" self‑test loop (#qa)
      *Build a tiny oracle DB + autogenerated question‑answer set; run daily to compare assistant output to ground‑truth and surface regressions.*

> _The backlog is intentionally short; move items to Work Streams when scheduled._

## 5. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| LLM hallucinations | Incorrect clinical insights | Medium | Keep deterministic post-processing; display code used |
| Data privacy breach | Legal & reputational | Low | Run models locally / mask PII; audit logging |
| Scope creep | Delays | Medium | Roadmap gatekeeper & time-boxed spikes |
| Test instability | Development friction | Medium | Implement robust mock strategy for visualization components |

## 6. Meta
- **Document owner:** @gmtfr  
- **Last updated:** 2025-05-05 # Synthetic Golden-Dataset Self-Test Loop completed with automated notification system
- **Edit instructions for AI assistants:**  
  • Maintain markdown table formatting.  
  • Use ✔/☐/🔄 symbols for status.  
  • Preserve section headers.  
  • Keep backlog ≤ 10 items; archive completed ones.
